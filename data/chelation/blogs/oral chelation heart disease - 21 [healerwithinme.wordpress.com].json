Mix powder thoroughly so that there is no dry charcoal floating on top of the water.</p>\n<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> If you leave dry powdered charcoal on top of the water, without mixing it thoroughly, you may breathe the dry powder through your nose as you are drinking and this can choke you and make a mess. Just make sure that the powdered charcoal is thoroughly stirred into the water to prevent this problem. <strong>You can also sip it through a straw to prevent these problems, especially for children.</strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have charcoal; continue with the ice or cold water procedure. This method will work just fine w/o it. The charcoal is used to capture toxins and to prevent possible nausea as the toxins are removed. Nausea only occurs if you go over the 20 minute time limit and overload your ascending colon w/ too many toxins. That\u2019s why it takes 6 treatments; you only want to remove a little at a time.</p>\n<p>Get a small, or medium size, plastic water bottle and fill it with cold water.

Put a pillow on the floor and lay face down with your head next to the floor. Place the water bottle on the lower right side of your stomach next to your thigh.</p>\n<p><strong>The cold will shrink the Appendix and cause the poisons that are causing the pain to be slowly squeezed out</strong> into the Ascending Colin which points straight up when you are sitting or standing. By laying on the slanted board the Ascending Colon is now slanted downward so that the poisons will now be pulled out of the Appendix and colon by gravity.</p>\n<p>Lay there for no more than 20 minutes with ice or 40 w/ cold water unless you have a fat stomach; then you should lay there for no more than 30 minutes w/the ice. This is so that all the poisons do not come out all at once and cause nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Do this once / day for 6 days and your appendicitis will be gone in most cases.</p>\n<p>Do this once per year to cleanse your appendix and you can prevent most cases of appendicitis.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The pain usually subsides within 2 hours.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If the pain increases in spite of this you must be operated on to prevent death.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">ARTHRITIS</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>RHEUMATISM OR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RHEUMATIC JOINT PAIN</strong></p>\n<p>10% of all Arthritis sufferers are allergic to the Nightshade family of fruits and vegetable: Tomatoes, Potatoes, Egg Plant, Peppers, Gogi berries and Tobacco are the most popular ones.

Aloe plants used to be kept growing in the kitchen to provide instant first aid from burns from a hot stove. Just remove the skin of the herb and rub the burn w/the soft jelly like Aloe for instant relief.</p>\n<p>Today we have learned how to stabilize Aloe Vera and now it can be preserved in a bottle for convenience but the fresh Aloe is best. I treated my son, Joel, who suffered a severe 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burn while working in an oil field in1979, w/ Aloe and wheat germ oil, to stop the itching, and it healed rapidly w/o a scar.</p>\n<p><strong>ATSUETE LEAVES &#8211; </strong>Wash leaves with soap and water. Steep for 10 leaves in 5 glasses of water. Let it cool. Soak the burn area for 10 minutes, once a day.</p>\n<p><strong>COLLOIDAL SILVER (CS) &#8211;</strong> Colloidal Silver is the fastest burn healer and most effective anti-microbial of all the burn treatments tested by the US govt. Spray CS on the burn. This disinfects and promotes very rapid healing. If you bandage the burn after spraying w/CS and leave the bandage on overnight the new skin will sometimes grow into the bandage overnight, if the bandage is touching the burn, and this is very painful to remove. So, put honey on after you spray w/CS to prevent the air and the bandage from touching the burn; and then bandage it and cover w/plastic to keep it from making a mess. Replace it 2X/day. (See honey below)</p>\n<p><strong>SABILA LEAVES </strong>Wash leaves with soap and water. Pound the leaves and extract the juice. Apply juice on the burn area after soaking the wound in warm salt solution once a day.</p>\n<p><strong>SILI LEAVES</strong> (pepper) Get 1/2 kilo leaves of the plant and have it pounded fine. Apply the juice to the first or second degree burns.</p>\n<p><strong>HONEY</strong> is found in most kitchens and is an excellent burn treatment, especially for 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns for two reasons. Infection is your #1 enemy without your skin covering the raw flesh. Honey turns to a dilute solution of Hydrogen Peroxide to kill infection on a raw burn. Honey, held in place with a bandage, provides a covering to prevent infection in 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns.</p>\n<p><strong>VITAMIN E OIL (WHEAT GERM OIL) </strong>stops the itching caused by the rapid healing from any of the above.</p>\n<p><strong>COLD WATER </strong>gives immediate relief from the pain which returns immediately when you remove the water (The colder the better, so put ice in the water if you can).</p>\n<p><strong>OIL AND OINTMENTS </strong>can make the pain worse on a fresh burn; but wheat germ oil can be used to prevent itching during the rapid healing process after the pain has subsided.</p>\n<p><strong>C.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">CANCER</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s easier to get rid of cancer than it is to keep it away. Cancer is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle; what we eat, breathe and drink. Eating factory processed food and drinks w/poisonous chemical additives is the #1 cause of cancer. Cancer loves sugar so starve it by quitting eating sugar. Read the article on sugar and soft drinks in the introduction. Also read <em>The China Study </em>again.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARTEMISIA ANNUA </strong>is an herb that is used to extract a drug for Malaria. It is very effective and is also reported to be 10 times more powerful than Chemotherapy in curing cancer. I have seen it cure cancers in the mouth (From chewing tobacco), and the small intestines in just 3 weeks with just 1 Tsp of Artemisia/day as a tea. My own brain tumor took several month w/8 Tsp./day as a tea to get rid of; but it started working immediately. I could feel the pain receding back across my head and down my neck as the tumor died a slow death. All cancer require 8 Tsp./day except for the digestive tract which only requires 1 Tsp./day because the Artemisia contacts the cancer directly and does not have to get to it through the bloodstream. (See the full article about ARTEMISIA ANNUA in the herb section.) <strong>Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)</strong> <strong>combined with COLLOIDAL SILVER delivers a one two punch to </strong>kill the micro-organisms that causes the abnormal cell growth that we call cancer. Here is how they work together.</p>\n<p><strong>DMSO is a byproduct of TREES</strong> after they are processed to make paper. It is a powerful penetrator through the skin and into the organs and bones.</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>There are life-giving properties in the \u2026pine,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u2026cedar, \u2026fir and other </em></strong><strong>TREES</strong><strong><em> also have properties</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>that are health restoring.\u201d </em></strong><em>{MH 264.2}</em></p>\n<p>Colloidal Silver does not kill cancer but it does kill all pathogens such as microbes, viruses, molds, yeast and fungi. (The drug companies do not have any drug that can safely kill a virus). Colloidal Silver can not penetrate a cancerous cell to kill the pathogen inside the cell which has caused it to turn cancerous. But when you combine DMSO with it the DMSO carries the colloidal silver inside the cancerous cell and kills the pathogen immediately on contact. Now the cell returns to normal with no need to kill it.</p>\n<p>Another example of DMSO being used as a penetrating carrier is when it is combined with glucosamine to treat some types of arthritis. Without them I can not walk because of the piercing pain in my hips. The doctors only answer is a hip replacement but I thank God once again for another natural treatment.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">CHICKEN POX</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>BALIMBING LEAVES</strong>(for itchiness) Crush or chop young leaves and extract the juice. Apply the juice on the skin or lesions to relieve the itchiness, 3 times a day. Don\u2019t rub juice on the skin. Do not scratch, especially on the face, because this will leave permanent scars. (I scratched some on my belly to get a scar in 1942 and I still have scars on my belly in 2012, so don\u2019t scratch!)

When the fever declines, warning signs may develop. This marks the beginning of a 24 to 48 hour period when the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) become excessively permeable (leaky), allowing the fluid component to escape from the blood vessels into the peritoneum (causing ascites) and pleural cavity (leading to pleural effusions). This may lead to failure of the circulatory system and shock, and possibly death without prompt, appropriate treatment. In addition, the patient with DHF has a low platelet count and hemorrhagic manifestations, tendency to bruise easily or have other types of skin hemorrhages, bleeding nose or gums, and possibly internal bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>NATURAL REMEDIES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OIL PULLING (See herb section) </strong></li>\n<li><strong>COLLOIDAL SILVER</strong></li>\n<li><strong>NEW STAR 7+1 Lifestyle and </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BETTER THAN ORGANIC food</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ARTEMISIA ANNUA</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dengue fever treatment</strong></p>\n<p>Avoid mosquito bites by using a mosquito repellent to avoid transmitting the disease through any mosquitoes that bite you while febril.</p>\n<p>Drink plenty of liquids and take Artemisia for fever and pain. <strong>Persons who think they have dengue can use analgesics (pain relievers) with acetaminophen and avoid those containing ibuprofen, Naproxen, or aspirin containing drugs </strong><strong>because they thin the blood and can promote hemorrhaging.</strong> They should also rest and drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.

In the evening of the second day drink a half cup of oil or half and half cream and milk. Some people can\u2019t stand the taste of oil. Now go to bed and lay on your right side all night with your right leg pulled up. This will cause the oil to rest against your gall bladder.</p>\n<p>The next morning go to the bathroom and you will see black gallstones floating on top of the water. Some may be as big as the end of your thumb or as small as 1/8\u201d or even like sand. Repeat in two weeks to be sure you got them all.</p>\n<p>Here is my favorite gall bladder flush story. I was conducting a three week lifestyle training session in Groveland, Florida, US, when an elderly lady named Bamby (Short for Bamberger, her last name) was brought in with pain in her right side. Bamby had been a young nurse for Dr. John Harvey Kellogg when he was very old.</p>\n<p>I told her that she had gall stones and she laughed at me and said, <em>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a gall bladder young man.\u201d</em> (I was 55 years old at the time she said this.) I told her that it was possible to have gall stones inside the liver; even though the Gall Bladder had been removed.</p>\n<p>Two days later she saw the evidence with her own eyes when she passed hundreds of Gall Stones. She was amazed and became a firm believer in The Gall Stone Flush. See Gall stones for a description of this method.</p>\n<p>How did I know it was a Gall Stone problem? I told them to bring all the food in her kitchen to me. She had a lot of Red beet tops which she loved to eat every day. They are one of the causes of Gall Stones. She was instructed to only eat them occasionally and to do a Gall Bladder Flush every six months. She was very happy not to have a second operation. A side note to this story was when I asked Bamby if Dr. John Harvey Kellogg had a colonic machine. She said, <em>\u201cOh yes, he had a Dirker colonic machine, which was the biggest and the best.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The medical people have made it illegal to administer colonics in many states.

The first pain you may feel is in your back or side just below your ribs. The pain becomes intense when the kidney stone or stones break loose and work their way from the kidney to the bladder through the ureter. The pain then radiates to your lower abdomen, groin and genital area. Passing a kidney stone can be excruciating and an experience you are not likely to forget.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They are formed when your urine becomes too concentrated.</strong> This is where lack of fluids comes in. The minerals or other substances in the urine begin to form into crystals. These crystals then can combine to form a stone. If the stones are small, they can pass into your bladder without causing damage.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finding the underlying cause is very important to stop them from forming again. The best thing you can do to prevent a recurrence is to drink plenty of water and by eating the right foods.</strong></p>\n<p>Other symptoms include cloudy or foul smelling urine, nausea, vomiting, frequent urge to urin-ate and fever and chills if there is an infection.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT </strong><strong>CAUSES</strong><strong> KIDNEY STONES?</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, a lack of fluids can be the cause. <strong>Water is especially important. Because of this factor you are more likely to have kidney stones if you live in a hot and dry climate or work in a hot environment.</strong></p>\n<p>Family health history is another cause. If your family has a history of kidney stones, then you are more likely to have them as well. Once you have had one or more, you are also at risk to develop them again.</p>\n<p>Men are more likely to have kidney stones as well as people between the ages 20 to 70 years old. Some diseases or health disorders are also a risk factor, such as tubular acidosis, gout, chronic urinary tract infections or cystinuria.</p>\n<p>Medications can be a cause. An example, diuretics may increase risk.</p>\n<p><strong>A high protein, low carb diet may be a cause. Sedentary life style over a prolonged period.

To begin with, the patient should fast on orange juice and water for 7 to 15 days depending on the severity of the fever. A warm-water enema should be administered daily during this period to cleanse the bowels. After the fever has subsided, the patient should be placed on an exclusive fresh fruit diet for further three days. In this regimen, he should take three meals a day, at five-hourly intervals, of fresh, juicy fruits like oranges, grapes, grape-fruit, apple, pineapple, mango and papaya. Thereafter, the patient may gradually embark upon a well-balanced diet of natural foods consisting of seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, with emphasis on fresh fruits and raw vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The patient should avoid black tea, coffee, refined and processed foods, fried foods, condiments, sauces, pickles, white sugar, white flour, and all products made from them. He should also avoid all meats, alcoholic drinks and smoking.</strong></p>\n<p>The best way to reduce temperature naturally, during the course of the fever, is by means of cold pack, which can be applied to the whole body. This pack is made by wringing out a sheet or other large square piece of linen material in cold water, wrapping it tight around the body and legs of the patient, (twice round would be best) and then covering completely with a small blanket or similar warm material. This pack should be applied every three hours during the day while temperature is high and kept on for an hour or so. Hot-water bottles may be applied to the feet and also against the sides of the body.</p>\n<p>The real cause of malaria is an unhealthy lifestyle, especially poor nutrition which clogs the system w/toxic waste that feeds the malaria.
