return.", "I would then use the black salve and it would be painful, yes, but it took the cancer away with no returning.", "After looking at Quackwatchs gruesome photos, I have come to realize that the swatch of skin that is missing from the womans face has been surgically removed (the clean straight edges show that it was cut away surgically).", "Now Im sure she probably used the black salve

safeguards in place, how is it that humans do get cancer?", "Unfortunately, cancer cells are able to subvert the checks and quality controls and sneak past the checkpoints.", "For every system of checks and repeat quality control tests that our bodies can invent, there seem to be an equal number of ways of subverting the system.", "Cancer gets a foothold and establishes itself as a viable entity in our bodies only when it has learned a way of getting around the checkpoints of the cell cycle.", "This is the stage at which the virus and microbe infection factor plays its role, because these supply programming to the cells to produce higher levels of the Cyclin Dependent Kinases that enable cells to pass the G1 and G2 checkpoints; or reduction of Cyclins, which prevent them doing so.", "They may also supply other systemic disobedience factors, such as an imitator of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin, a hormone that selectively suppresses the pregnant mothers immune response against her own baby in-utero.", "This allows the malignant cells to protect themselves from immune response.", "In cases of drug-resistant cancers, they are responsible for providing the programming by which the cells can produce more export pump proteins to get rid of toxins.", "The Kinases are proteins that control the cell cycle, but most of the time they are in an inactive form.", "To be active the Kinases must be associated with another type of protein called Cyclins.", "Hence they are called Cyclin-Dependent Kinases or CDKs.", "CDKs control the various checkpoints, they are the gatekeepers that decide whether to pass or fail cells as they go through the various quality control checkpoints in the cell cycle.", "Cyclins are frequently over-expressed in human cancers (for example, the tell-tale marker for Mantle Cell Leukaemia is over expression of Cyclin D1), lowering the bar for the checkpoints, letting just any malignant cell to pass the checkpoint and on its way to reproduction.", "Another common feature of cancer cells is decrease in the function of inhibitors of CDKs.", "Think of these peptides (p16 and p21 are two important genes that encode them) as the supervisors that keep an eye on the CDKs, to make sure they do not drop the standards too low.", "When the supervisors are asleep on the job, and the CDKs get lax in their standards, malignant cells can pass the checkpoints and proliferate.", "This is one of the most common features of all cancers.", "The presumption where malignancy is concerned (and it is a central one) is that the bodys repair and healing mechanisms have been caused to go awry.", "The process of healing and repair may be perceived to comprise four distinct Phases.", "First of these is the Inflammation Phase, being a response to cell deaths via tissue damage or cell redundancy.", "It involves inflammatory agents such as Nitric Oxide and enzymes such as Cox and LPO.", "The second is the Cleanup Phase, which is an immune system response, whereby white blood cells move in to clean up the debris and make way for new replacement cells.", "The third is the Proliferation Phase, which follows the triggering of inflammation and cleanup, whether by external agents or by the bodys own regulation mechanisms that involve Nitric Oxide, 5-LPO, Cox-1 or Cox-2 and a cascade of events takes place involving angiogenesis (VEGF-driven) to repair or initiate new blood supplies to an affected region, plus the triggering of Stem Cells (also called Mast Cells, driven by EGF & other factors) into generating replacement cells for the damaged or destroyed tissues.", "They do this through mitotic replication, by following the cell cycle explained above.", "The fourth is the Differentiation Phase, in which the cells newly generated from stem cells through the Proliferation Phase progressively undergo a differentiating process of maturation into various specialised cells.", "Dedicated stem cells have no function other than to multiply in order to replace missing, damaged or malfunctioning tissues, though intermediate types exist, which can perform some functions other than multiplying fibroblasts and some leucocytes, for example.", "As they multiply and regulated as they normally are by Cluster of Differentiation markers, Interleukins, WNT cell signalling proteins, CDKs and other agents, they progressively develop more specialised morphologies along a path of differentiation in which they eventually mature into dedicated cells of various specialised functions.", "Once they become fully differentiated and matured, they cease dividing and take up their required functions in the tissues.", "By doing all this, they would have progressed through this Differentiation Phase and if not for this, they could never mature and thus never assume their proper roles in the new tissues.", "As already explained, cell cycle CDK regulation plays a significant role in the Proliferative Phase of healing, so failure of its regulation can set the wheels of carcinogenesis in motion.", "But further, as a result of any of the foregoing conditions, the bodys repair mechanisms are also caused to become faulty in some degree in the Differential Phase of healing, because not only have malignant cells devised means of slipping past the CDK radar, but also inherited the means to defy maturation signals that would otherwise direct them to mature, cease dividing, assume designated roles in the tissues where they are generated and obey systemic regulation signals so that they behave as they should and perform their required functions correctly.", "Cancer as a biodynamic process is effectively the interference with these vital Proliferative and Differential Phases of the normal healing and repair process, in which multiplying cells pass replication tests when they shouldnt and then do not mature in this way and so never assume their proper functional roles but just go on multiplying, instead.", "In effect, cancer is an abnormal perpetuation of the Proliferation Phase of healing and failure of the Differentiation Phase to initiate and complete the regeneration process.", "Certain regulating mechanisms in either the Proliferative Phase or the Differentiation Phase (or both) have been caused to fail in some ways and the preceding passages on the Cell Cycle describe some of the key mechanisms.", "Having said this, the nature of cancerous cells is still intrinsically different from that of healthy Stem Cells.", "They are affected to the extent that they may no longer respond satisfactorily to the bodys normal regulating mechanisms, even if those regulating mechanisms were to be fully restored.", "They have inherited from the viruses and microbes, by DNA recombination or the production of specific biochemicals, the will and the ability to survive and function much more independently of their healthy parent tissues than healthy tissue cells do.", "These bodily repair mechanisms are orchestrated to some considerable extent by the Immune System, indicating that at least some prior loss of its functionality is already demonstrated by the mere presence of cancer.", "And so any of these conditions additionally lead to the Immune Systems functionality being further compromised.", "These are key factors in carcinogenesis.", "(a) Functionally oxygen deficient, which may not be a lung or haemoglobin malfunction, but an oxygen transport malfunction across cell membranes.", "Such a failure may well be connected with poor Calcium utilisation, because this metal is a key element in the process.", "However, literal Calcium deficiency is actually quite uncommon but in order to utilise Calcium correctly, the body also needs Magnesium.", "Magnesium deficiency is relatively common in developed countries.", "Systemic toxicity caused by heavy metals like Lead, Platinum, Cadmium and Mercury tends to interfere with trace mineral utilisation, so it can be a contributing oxygen transport interference factor.", "(b) Immunologically compromised, because Oxygen deficiency leads invariably to this condition.", "The bodys leucocyte army and its regulating mechanisms need oxygen, like any other cell types, to function optimally.", "In general, I consider their need for (and consumption of) oxygen is second only to neurons the most oxygen-hungry cells in the entire body.", "It is not to say that they are unconditional causality factors, because in truth, theyre not they do not cause cancer in every person in which they are present.", "There are NO exceptions to either of these imperatives.", "They must therefore be regarded as cornerstones in causality theory and a basis upon which prevention and treatment principles are developed.", "I call these the Oxygen Deficiency Imperative Theorem (ODIT) and the Compromised Immune System Imperative Theorem (CISIT).", "Further to that, there is a very strong parallel between the behaviour of malignant colonies and a gestating foetus.", "The similarities are startling [see Trophoblast Theory and Immunoplacental Therapy (Dr. Valentin Govallo) in Chapter Six, which looks at Gonadotrophins hCG and bCG].", "Still further yet, my VIMTOCC model (Virally Infected Microbe Theory Of Cancer Causality) has finally evolved to the point where it can plausibly account for causality of ALL cancers.", "Whether factually so without any exceptions still remains to be established.", "When immunity is compromised as it surely must be when oxygen deficiency is present, opportunistic infection can easily take place, involving invasion of viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms or activation and proliferation of previously dormant ones already present in the system.", "It is not just any microbes, but a cohort of apparently cooperative (or semi-cooperative) pathogens, which collectively exhibit a specific range of biological tendencies.", "This is a critical stage in which the cancerous condition actually manifests under a regime of microbial causality.", "Microbes viruses, bacteria, yeasts and protists account for causality of an undetermined, yet nevertheless large proportion of all cancers.", "There was a time around the middle of the 20th Century when 100% microbial causality of cancer was more or less universally accepted.", "It fell from grace, but the reasons are unclear.", "Despite that, I believe the combined activity of these various microbes actually represents the major proportion of all cancer causalities and further, that all others are characterised by the legacy of previous microbial infections, whereby dormant stem cells inherit the knowledge of how to turn rogue from microbes, but do not activate until much later in the lives of the otherwise apparently uninfected victims.", "Yet that is in disagreement with existing beliefs among many (but certainly not all) of the present-day biologists and cancer scientists whose estimates on viral cancer causality alone vary considerably.", "I noted during May, 2013 that R. Webster Kehr (Cancer Tutor) now also asserts that microbial infection is universal to all cases of carcinogenesis.", "He did not arrive at his conclusions out of any influence from me, but it is strongly indicated that he did so via the same general stream of research revelations that led me to postulate VIMTOCC.", "Those relate mostly to Rifes electromedical technology of the 1930s to 1950s; the development of an electromedical protocol in 1990 by Doctors Lyman and Kaali and the adoption, use and refinement of it by Bob Beck, in which 100% remission rates have been recorded through the use of both these technologies.", "All of them pinned causality on microbial activity.", "If they achieved perfect remission results, even against terminal cancers, then who should question their conclusions?", "I am in full agreement with Webster that these are the most powerful cancer treatments on Planet Earth.", "They are unique, in that no other treatment modalities, regardless of whether they may be Ancient Traditional, Alternative or Orthodox in nature, are known to produce such curative results.", "Notwithstanding the beliefs of Rife, Lyman, Kaali, Beck, Webster, myself and other cancer researchers, those viral estimates I am currently acquainted with are: 10% (Cancer Research UK); 15% (Professor Ian Frazer & Colleagues); and 25% (Raven & Johnsons 1989 university biology teaching text).", "87% of cervical cancers, in addition to their 100% viral causality, also have demonstrated bacterial involvement, since it is proven that HPV-16 has been shown to infect Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium bacteria, all four of which have shown up in cervical cancer biopsies in that proportion of 87%.", "Apart from this specific instance, there are no other estimates made public by biologists or orthodox cancer scientists on relative proportions of bacterial, protozoic, yeast or other fungal cancer causality at least, none to my current knowledge.", "However, the greater proportion of stomach cancers are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter Pylori and it can be safely surmised that it is equally true of intestinal cancers oesophageal, duodenal, colon, anal and so on more so, when one introduces virally infected Enterococcus and other Cocci into the equation as indicated by the cervical cancer biopsies.", "It indirectly suggests a 4% to 25% bacterial involvement factor of current and active infection in penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oral and pharyngeal cancers in addition to whatever Helicobacter Pylori causes.", "And that is to say nothing of prior infection legacies.", "cancer causalities remain a contested issue.", "Most mainstream cancer scientists deny any involvement of yeasts in the phenomenon and effectively quote a 0% estimate.", "Meanwhile conversely, there are several medical practitioners who have treated cancer patients in their clinics or dedicated cancer hospitals and have quoted 100% yeast involvement, saying that every single patient of theirs with cancer had a Candida yeast presence usually Candida Albicans.", "This species and Candida Parapsilosis are certified producers of carcinogenic toxins.", "In addition, many infectious moulds Aspergillus Flavus, A. Parasiticus & A. Ochraceus and some strains of A. Niger are factually known to produce carcinogenic toxins such as Aflatoxin and Ochratoxin, indicating the likelihood that several other related species do likewise.", "Many Penicillium, Stachybotris, Microsporum, Trichophyton and probably other genera of moulds also produce carcinogens.", "There are no estimates on Aspergillus cancer causalities, nor indications of just how infectious these funghi are.", "It has been indicated that Aspergillus infection is by spores inhaled into the lungs.", "There, in the Alveoli, they grow into funghi, form tumours called Aspergillomas and also migrate via the blood to just about anywhere else in the body.", "Aflatoxin is one of the most potent carcinogens known to medical science.", "It was during 2011, I was able to verify Candida Albicans and Candida Parapsilosis do in fact produce carcinogenic toxins.", "That now adds direct and active carcinogenesis to their possible, or even probable contributory roles by providing anaerobic fermentation of sugars to produce energy; and also their facilitating cellular penetration by viruses and bacteria.", "Giving account for these microbially caused cancers is the model I call Virally Infected Microbe Theory Of Cancer Causality (VIMTOCC).", "The most common cancers occur in epithelial, endothelial, mesothelial, endocrine, exocrine and bloodforming tissue types, partly due to the short life expectancy of healthy cells in such tissues and the consequently high rate of ongoing replacement that is necessary to maintain those tissues in good order; and partly due to their higher-than-usual degree of exposure to pathogens or carcinogens than most other tissue types.", "These two main factors combined result in a much higher risk that the healing regulation processes can more easily fail in membranous, endocrine, exocrine and bloodforming tissue (immune system) types; and thereby result in carcinogenesis in any glands, membranes or leucocytes lungs, blood & lymph vessels, intestines and so on or indeed in any tissues with a high proportion of active stem cells.", "This in turn leads to a further cascade of events, mainly at the cellular level.", "They include the production of abnormally high levels of certain aberrant bioregulatory or modulatory proteins, enzymes and hormones; or the inhibition of others needed for healthy metabolism and regulation.", "They may be triggered in the microorganisms by virii, or they may be triggered in the cells by either virii or various other microorganisms.", "Among them are undifferentiating agents or differentiation inhibitors, which cause cells to regress into (or perpetually remain in) abnormal stem cell states, where they continue multiplying instead of naturally progressing towards maturation.", "These invading microbes are also responsible for apoptosis mediation inhibitors that prevent actions that normally induce a cell to die when it is no longer satisfactorily functional; plus still others that inhibit the Immune System from getting rid of them.", "The pathway of carcinogenesis may progress through pre-cancerous phases via formation of noncancerous or precancerous tumours or growths, such as moles, warts, papillomas or other hyperplastic and neoplastic abnormalities.", "In any case, the tissue maintenance and repair system is functionally degraded in at least some degree when this occurs.", "Cells created to replace damaged or redundant ones cease to differentiate in the correct manner.", "Instead, they continue to multiply and ultimately fail to mature properly, so they cannot assume their properly assigned roles in the tissues.", "If they remain clustered together to form a distinct and aberrant growth, they are often referred to as neoplasms.", "Substitution of genetic material with that from viruses by the virii themselves occurs in the infected microorganisms and also in the host cells, further driving the cascade of abnormal biochemical reaction pathways and accelerating the process of cellular mutation.", "This mutation may depend somewhat on whether the viral genetic material is DNA or RNA.", "Foreign DNA and RNA interpose the biochemical pathways of a living cell at different stages in those biochemical processes DNA pretty much directly at the genetic level (it is recombinant and therefore definitely mutagenic), while RNA does so at the transmission of information level, becoming responsible for encoding aberrant proteins and so on as if there were some genetic mutation present, but not necessarily stemming from nuclear mutation, itself; nor necessarily leading to it.", "This in turn presupposes, in the case of a legacy microbial infection being the cause of carcinogenesis, that the culprit must have been Recombinant DNA not RNA, nor residual carginogenic chemicals.", "Energy and nutrition requirements in the affected cells increase dramatically as they enter into a perpetual cycle of mitosis (cell division), because it requires more resources to sustain the increased metabolic activity of a malignant cell.", "Bacterial or yeast interference with the Krebs Cycle may occur also and whether or not this occurs, anaerobic respiration becomes the major process by which ATP and/or other energy carriers are created to power the cell replication process.", "The demand is possibly met by yeasts or some types of bacteria, since the Mitochondria may no longer meet the energy demand alone.", "Glucose and Insulin demand increases much more drastically to fuel this energy requirement, since although anaerobic glycolysis is conveniently faster, it is also about 19 times less efficient than aerobic metabolism of sugars.", "The infected cells are forced to generate far more glucose and insulin receptors than is normal in healthy cells, in order to import the required amounts of fuel and other materials.", "The byproduct of this anaerobic glycolysis is lactic acid, which becomes a toxic factor.", "The poorer efficiency means that production of lactic acid and probably other toxic byproducts is vastly increased.", "These cells typically have much more permeable membranes than healthy cells they are described as being leaky.", "At least some of that permeability may be attributable to the cells multiplying rabidly in a nutritionally deficient environment, whereby they are unable to generate fully formed membranes and other substructures (perhaps by skimping on the length of the lipid chains in the membrane bilayers and/or other shortcuts).", "Normally, such cells would die of their own accord through internal apoptosis mediation or systemic regulation, but with immortalisation agents like excessive CDKs being present or with suppressors of p16, p21 and other related genes, they dont necessarily die, at all.", "In some other cases, they may have been made leaky by enzymes causing proteolysis or lipolysis (destruction of proteins or lipids in cell membranes), such as those produced by Yeasts.", "They may also simply be using short cuts to obtain nutritional resources and discharge wastes more easily.", "However, bacteria produce an array of additional substances as mentioned, such as anti-apoptogens (sometimes called immortalising agents) and masking proteins or immuno-downregulators such as Chorionic Gonadotrophins to inhibit immune response;

or the creation of new complications.", "Fairly close monitoring is necessary for several reasons.", "Firstly, total tumour mass may be expected to be not much less around the commencement of this Phase than it was at commencement of the Stabilisation Phase and may even be greater.", "Whilst it is desirable to reduce that mass as swiftly as possible, the rate of reduction must be very carefully limited by the risk of Tumour Lysis Syndrome.", "As such, Potassium, Phosphate and Calcium levels must be closely watched.", "Secondly, the duration of this Phase must be determined according to the Law Of Diminishing Returns.", "When the rate of tumour mass regression becomes noticeably slower, this is probably an indicator that the remaining malignancy comprises a higher proportion of resistant cells.", "It marks the time when the Sensitive Malignancy Phase must give way to the Resistant Malignancy Phase.", "In the special case of refractory cancers where minimal or no population regression by the typical differentiators, apoptogens or necrotics can be achieved, this treatment Phase is immediately superseded by the Late Phase with the employment of Acetogenins, Berberine and selected adjuvants or supplements.", "The same approach may also be employed temporarily as part of the Stabilisation Phase in cases where the cancer is very advanced or very aggressive, in order to gain a satisfactory respite.", "However, a separate Emergency Strategy was devised with that in mind and is described in Section E of this Chapter.", "RESISTANT MALIGNANCY PHASE (Late): This Phase is a special stage of the strategy, which recognises that drug-resistant malignancies require special treatment quite distinct from that applied to the more general malignant population.", "Here, Acetogenins mainly represent the best answer to this special problem of a resistant population, both in cancer cells and microbes, because they are so specifically effective in neutralising the function of molecular efflux pumps and their associated mediators.", "Since there is a potential neural side effect problem that must be considered with heavy or extended use of Acetogenins, their otherwise powerful efficacy against any cancer cells or bacteria is not taken advantage of during the earlier phases, unless it is made imperative by other considerations.", "This avoids possible neural complications arising unnecessarily and it also permits the use of a range of other agents that are incompatible with Acetogenins during other Phases.", "During this Late Phase, the Acetogenins serve the purpose of eliminating the MDRC and MDRM populations including residual metastatic ones, as well as helping to clean up surviving viruses.", "Berberine is another option with MDRM and MDRC efficacy.", "They are also expected to eradicate most of the residual CSC population, but not all, since Acetogenins like Bullatacin have shown themselves to be merely cytostatic towards some lines of CSC, rather than cytotoxic.", "This being the case, the use of Acetogenins may not constitute the complete solution these Acetogenin-static CSCs can hold their own until the treatment is discontinued and then resume propagating.", "However, it is known that Acetogenins cause accumulation of other toxins, including any adjuvant drugs used and it is also known that agents such as Piperine and Chavicine retard metabolism and so cause a similar condition.", "Assuming that preconditioning and cell differentiating treatments have been administered prior to the execution of this Phase; and on the further presumption that they can also be selectively used during this Phase, it should nevertheless be possible to produce a definitively positive result with certain adjuvant cytotoxic agents and Immune System modulators.", "Since what remains to the Acetogenins during this Phase should normally be a relatively small surviving population, the duration and indeed the overall dosage of Acetogenins required to complete the task should be minimal.", "It should not exceed thirty days, the recommended limit of time over which a sustained course of Acetogenins should be administered before a spell is taken.", "But it is critical to ensure that the cancer is eliminated to the extent that it will not relapse, due to even a small surviving number of resistant cells, stem cells or bacteria.", "In the special case of refractory cancers of any kind, the Sensitive Malignancy Phase is superseded by this Resistant Malignancy Phase, which presumes that Acetogenins and some other selected supplements must be kept in use for longer than would otherwise be necessary.", "It is hoped that in such instances, the course should still not exceed thirty days and that in any case, neural detriment is kept minimal.", "Mainly during the Stabilisation Phase, a treatment called Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy can be used to improve tolerance of (and protection from) the oxidative effects of Acetogenins, but that may not ameliorate susceptibility to neuropathy.", "It is also hoped that THC may offer a compatible solution to the increased risk to the Central Nervous System through its neuroprotective and neural regenerative properties.", "Both approaches might allow extension of an Acetogenin course, but this latter approach using THC still needs to be tested somehow and so must be regarded with reserve.", "One might consider trying it if other measures fail.", "THC itself has a very high safety ratio, where dosage can be optimised easily to within the optimal neuroprotective range without danger, except to that 0.1% of the population which may be susceptible to psychotic episodes;

Kennedy MC.", "Statistics provided were very simple and basic, but show a clear and definite pattern of profound superiority over any kind of non-augmented conventional chemotherapy.", "The book is titled, HOPE Medicine & Healing.", "I came to understand why such stats were bare and basic.", "More importantly, I was given insight into a fully integrated cancer treatment philosophy VERY, VERY SIMILAR to that which I had already devised and set down here under these Chapter Two HICS headings, Fundamental Treatment Principles; Phases In A Cancer Treatment Strategy; and PICTS Phased Integrative Cancer Treatment Strategy.", "It came as a surprise, for Id previously believed Contreras used a rather more ad hoc range of protocols, including DMSO-Laetrile.", "The components of my own integrative cancer treatment system are as described above and in what follows.", "They are embraced collectively under what I call the Holistically Integrated Cancer Strategy.", "Too few cancer treatment protocols (and none known to me in orthodox oncology) are fully integrated approaches to cancer treatment.", "Consequently, I was greatly heartened to learn that SOMEBODY out there is actually practising a variant of what I preach in Cancers Answers.", "The Oasis Of Hope version is called IRT Integrative Regulatory Therapy.", "It supersedes what I previously believed Contreras to have been doing in cancer treatment.", "I have also since discovered that there are several other institutions besides Oasis Of Hope that provide Integrative Cancer Therapies.", "Its a good sign and clearly points the direction in which cancer therapy must evolve in future.", "I also learned a bit more about some particular details of cancer treatment that were too good to overlook, so I appropriately added another modification to my PICT Strategy as a pre-eminent extension of the Oxygen Treatment and Protectives & Rescues items already listed, plus some extra information to two or three other small items.", "The new major Item is called Preconditioning.", "So, I have Contreras to thank for some significant improvements.", "Contreras strategies dont appear to overtly attack the microbe aspects of cancer causality as I advocate; and indeed, the book doesnt even mention microbes in the cancer context.", "But the funny thing is that it doesnt matter too much.", "Their strategies are so similar to mine, that they actually do address microbial infection issues as a perfectly natural matter of course.", "The system of treatments they employ cannot fail to do this.", "Oasis Of Hope does not yet appear to have embraced the use of Acetogenins, Berberine, Myrrh or some other natural agents, but does have approaches designed to overcome multi-drug resistance via resensitisation.", "I suspect theyre not quite as good as Acetogenins, but they are unquestionably more effective than typical orthodox treatments in this regard and it is a critical element of success in cancer treatment.", "Contreras doctors are very progressive in their thinking, however; and even quite legitimately redefine success in cancer treatment.", "So I have a feeling they may well integrate Acetogenins into their therapies in future and possibly even embrace the microbial aspects more deliberately, too.", "There is one particular area in which the doctors at Contreras and I disagree.", "That is in believing that no natural anticarcinomic compounds are as potent as the orthodox ones for regressing tumour masses.", "Consequently, Contreras selectively uses orthodox chemo agents coupled with protective agents and potentiators to achieve the predominant tumour regression.", "I maintain that there ARE such powerful natural anticarcinomic agents, though they do not act as swiftly as the orthodox agents.", "Of course, these are the Acetogenins.", "One of these (Bullatacin) is 1,000 million (a billion) times more potent than Adriamicin for a couple of cell lines, including Prostate.", "Two more (Asiminocin and Trilobacin) are a million million (a trillion) times more potent than Adriamicin, again for certain specific cell lines.", "All three are found in natural North American Paw Paw.", "As far as Im aware, the ONLY orthodox chemo drugs approaching this kind of potency are some of the Platinum drugs notably Triplatin Tetranitrate.", "However, almost ALL of the Platins are dangerously toxic they just dont have a satisfactory safety profile to go with their potency.", "In any case, all Platin drugs have another serious weakness, because for all their cytotoxic potency, they cant beat MDRCs without causing collateral destruction that is far too massive to the point of literally being lethal to the patient.", "Orthodox TKI or CDKI drugs are actually much better in that particular respect, but Acetogenins are still far superior!", "This is the area in which Contreras Hospital would do better by adopting the use of Acetogenins and augmenting that with the use of the Curcumin & Piperine combination, plus a select few other agents like Berberine, Entelev, Cancell or Protocel and perhaps even Antineoplastons.", "In doing so, erstwhile difficulties so often experienced in treating multi-drug resistant cancers will be dramatically reduced, if not eliminated.", "It is fortunate for people in North America that Paw Paw is easily available, since it is native to that continent.", "Australians are currently not so blessed Paw Paw seeds and herbal extract products seem to be heavily overshadowed to the point of concealing displacement by a vile marketing strategy involving the misnomenclature of Carica Papaya to masquerade as Paw Paw (Asimina Triloba).", "I intend to change that unsatisfactory situation, for although Paw Paw dried leaf and stem is actually permitted to pass through Australian Customs, seeds are not.", "Papaya is an anticarcinomic plant I have largely overlooked to date.", "That may be unfair, because as I continuously sift through data concerning cancer treatment, interesting little snippets of information do pop up from time to time.", "Papaya is used as an adjuvant in cancer treatment by at least one Queensland hospital, but that is not what I have recently found to be of interest.", "Instead, this next thing in my journey of discovery was previously overlooked, even though it was right under my nose, until something in the Black Salve literature triggered a connection moment in my head.", "That next thing is proteolysis of immune masking proteins by certain enzymatic compounds called Proteases.", "Now, there are components in Black Salve which are said to contain these, but it happens that Papaya expresses Papain proteases.", "Could Papaya exhibit similar unmasking properties to Black Salve and thereby enable immune response against erstwhile disguised cancer cells?", "Research is ongoing, but if confirmed, then this or perhaps even certain evolutions of Black Salve or Hoxsey tonics may become the cornerstone agents of a new PICTS Component #30 Unmasking Proteases.", "Proteases notwithstanding, where Papaya is otherwise concerned, Big Pharma has been pulling strings again, which is nothing new, but which absolutely must cease and must be reversed.", "Further, the production and marketing of drugs such as Nitrogen Mustards, Nitrosoureas, Anthracyclines, MABs, rDNAs, Platins, Avandia, Botox, Vioxx, Gardasil, Statins and a host of other filthy crimes against humanity must be outlawed and the progenitors and approvers of them must be prosecuted with utmost prejudice under the Law which of course is never going to happen, regardless.", "These are drugs which have permanently damaged and killed people, some drugs individually into the tens of thousands of fatalities during the last eighty years.", "Its the Worlds Number One cause of liver failure and liver failure means death.", "On a global scale, the collective death toll directly attributable to such drugs runs into the tens of millions.", "They almost rival cancer itself and are Americas sixth biggest killer at around 100,000 fatalities annually according to one source, or 160,000 according to another source dated from the early 1990s, without including illicit drug use, but even yet, there is another claim at large that the annual American fatality rate from normal drug use runs to 600,000.", "Update: Vioxx and Avandia have been withdrawn from the market!", "Two down hundreds still to go.", "Mexico has also been the centre of pioneering work with an artificial Oxygen carrier called Perftec, mainly due to chronic shortage of donor blood in hospitals whereby they were forced to look for a Haemoglobin substitute.", "The magic substance is an Oxygen chelating Porphyrin like Haemoglobin and has enormous potential in cancer therapy.", "Contreras uses this agent in its Redox Therapy.", "Contreras is now spearheading change in cancer treatment in the US, having expanded from Mexico and established a hospital in San Diego, California.", "It is apparently so much so that MSK and NCI are now beginning to change their tunes and are more readily embracing complementary cancer treatments, if not alternative or fully integrated ones that they formerly took every opportunity to discredit.", "I have added a whole new Section devoted to the description of Contreras IRT, based upon the contents of that fine, eloquent little book they sent me in their generosity.", "In it, I also reflect the great importance Contreras places upon the spiritual component of wellness and indeed the whole outlook based upon FAITH, together with a factual scientific basis for its beneficence.", "Of course, my belief system is Agnostic, while theirs is classic Christian indeed, it is Roman Catholic, but of very enlightened flavour, richly imbued with excellent understanding of Jesuss philosophy and teachings.", "That is very significant, for Jesus was more than Davidian Jew, Gallilean or Nazarene.", "He was ESSENE, not by birth as most Essenes at Wadi Qumran, Mount Carmel, the Nile Delta and the Himalayas were, but by choice and teaching.", "He was a Holy Man who travelled widely and learned a great deal that included the herbal as well as spiritual healing disciplines practised by the Essenes basically, he adopted the Essene ways and fused them with his hereditary Judaism.", "This is why his teachings were in very sharp contrast to either the orthodox Jewish OR the Roman religious ways of thinking at the time.", "And Contreras holds true to his vision you dont need to be religious to appreciate that.", "The new Section G in Chapter Six will enable you to compare Contreras strategies with mine.", "I trust it will help you to better appreciate the DIFFERENCE that fully integrated cancer therapies such as theirs represent in the treatment of this terrible disease and moreover, the difference they make to peoples lives in a far broader context than simple medical health alone.", "It is not to say they have all the answers they dont.", "It is to say that there is a seriously significant difference for the better when compared with the abysmal performance of orthodox oncology.", "I am confident that Contreras is going to put Americas cancer treatment orthodoxy on its complacent, heartless, soulless, greedy, corrupt, parasitic bloody backside; and spearhead the coming of a New Age in oncology.", "The same may be said of other institutions offering similar integrative therapy regimes several of these are now listed in the Directories.", "I seriously hope similar initiatives will soon burgeon here in Australia; and so much the better if it becomes a global phenomenon.", "Issels Treatment: This is an impressive Integrative Cancer Medicine system which again appears to strongly resemble HICS.", "A feature of the Issels Treatment is Infrared Therapy and my studies indicate this is an extremely

apoptosis in malignant cells and does likewise with microbes because it also binds with Bacterial Complex I, which is a similar but smaller and simpler proton pump called Ubiquinol Oxidase.", "For another example, its a potent protein cleaving enzyme, giving fairly strong credence to the unproven theory that it can unmask cancer cells by destroying the membrane proteins which provide the disguise.", "There are several protein types it is active against.", "In most of its bioactions, its potency is such that very small amounts in the range of 0.1 to 10 Micromoles produces any of several specific effects at up to 100% efficacy.", "As a bone resorption inhibitor, for instance, it is 100% effective at less than 1 Micromole.", "When you look at these four properties, you might

over millions of years in a complex mix of competitive and symbiotic relationships.", "As new species develop via evolution from their ancestors, they progressively acquire new abilities to survive,

devised by bacteria between 1 and 1.5 billion years ago.", "Plants did the same in both this process and that of photosynthesis.", "Thus, we share biochemical similarities in varying degrees with other organisms and did ourselves evolve with a nutritional and medicinal dependency on other organisms particularly plants.", "Nowhere is this more true than where it applies to medicine.", "Species of Larrea (Zygophyll Family) and in particular, L.

strongly recommend keeping dosages very small.", "The lignans in Chaparral had IC50 values against several cancer cell lines of 5-60 micromole with the linear butane-type lignans being the most

the toxin mobilising effects of NDGA are the real cause.", "It extracts embedded toxins from the tissues and thus puts them into circulation in the blood and lymph, such that the Liver must then process them via glucuronidation to facilitate removal from the system.", "This is why it qualifies as a detox agent.", "Because the detox process at a systemic level is still dependent on the Liver

this stuff by researching Flux Capacitors and comparing the phenomenon with the dynamics of any atom or Baryon.", "They are consistent and the possibility that the phenomenon might be caused by one of the four forces other than Gravity (Electric, Magnetic, Weak Nuclear or Strong Nuclear) was logically and easily eliminated.", "More recently, a reference to charge density came to my attention in literature about DNA and an anticancer agent called Poly-MVA.", "I followed it up in ever-increasing depth and found several examples of scientific research that provide considerable corroboration without much conflicting data at all; so inevitably, a cascade of realisations occurred in lieu of all this.", "Yes, apparently, DNA can acquire and hold a zone-separated differential of electric charge density.", "This suggested that DNA should in theory be consequently capable of generating Gravity independently of the natural tendency of its individual atoms and baryons to do so.", "Would it be static gravitational force, or could emission and/or absorption of gravitational waves also manifest?", "Was there scientific corroboration to be found for either or both phenomena?", "One of the noteworthy experiments was that in which human corpses were precisely weighed shortly after death and continued to be weighed at intervals over a longer period of time beyond death.", "It was shown that the weight of these corpses changed independently of their actual mass.", "The researchers reported something to the effect that, The human spirit has been weighed.", "I formed the hypothesis that this may not have been the spirit leaving the body as such, but the effect of DNA losing electric charge (leakage without recharge) over time following death.", "That, according to my reasoning, would result in loss of static gravitational force being generated by the DNA.", "Hardly conclusive, of course, but keep in mind the behaviour of flux capacitors which hundreds of hobbyists around the world seem to like playing with.", "Then couple that with what you often witness when you watch top-level basketball matches.", "You see players take flying leaps at the hoop and their trajectories through the air appear to defy the earths gravity to a degree gravity should pull them down sooner than it actually does.", "Their trajectories are slightly longer and slightly flatter than they should be for the velocity at which they travel for just a very short moment in time.", "I have done the very same thing, myself on a couple of occasions only, but never so consistently as elite athletes regularly do and not to such an easily observable degree as they do, either.", "Always in these cases, overdoses of adrenaline are involved.", "Nervous system activity is dramatically intensified.", "Their perception of the lapsing of time changes, too.", "These moments in flight seem to happen in slow motion to those who are performing the feat.", "High jumpers and pole vaulters also use it, together with a finely trained physical discipline of moving one part of the body through a height above the centre of mass with exquisite timing, so that they can clear the bar without the centre of mass attaining the required height for them to do so.", "But this discipline cannot alter the trajectory of the centre of mass.", "Its the former phenomenon which does that.", "OK, so if its a valid observation, there must be a mechanism that makes modification of a trajectory possible.", "Enter the next very interesting corroboration a DNA experiment by Drs.", "Vladimir Poponin and Peter Gariaev, conducted simultaneously in Russia and the USA.", "They set up a vaccuum chamber in each location and put a laser beam through it.", "Predictably, the light was not influenced.", "Then they placed DNA in the chamber and repeated the laser application.", "This time, the beam was influenced and inherited a coherent interference pattern.", "However, what they did next was to remove the DNA altogether and put the beam through the chamber again.", "One should expect that the interference pattern should not happen, but it did.", "Moreover, the lasers interference pattern persisted for almost a month afterwards in each of several such tests conducted.", "What force caused the interference to persist like that?", "Only one force comes up trumps the one that can alter the character and topography of Spacetime, itself Gravity of the static kind.", "Time was locally dilated within the chamber, for if it were not so, the laser interference pattern should not have manifested at all when the DNA was removed.", "Therefore, in the converse, Space was locally compressed a clear gravitational effect.", "OK, so what about Gravity waves?", "These are generated and propagated by alternating a static gravitational force.", "For a demonstration of that, one needs to look at The Intention Experiment per Dr. Lynne McTaggart.", "Static Gravity could not have done what occurred in that series of experiments, because cause and effect EVENTS were influenced at the quantum level.", "Only gravity waves can do that, by being intercepted and absorbed by remote matter-energy systems but more significantly in this particular case, by minds and the resultant human behaviour.", "Could DNA have been responsible for manifesting gravity waves that were modulated by INTENTION in this manner?", "Are human minds influenced by gravity waves encoded with thought?", "And could it not only explain this, but the observations by quantum physicists that sub-elementary particles routinely pop into existence to be observed as a result of the INTENT to observe them?", "It is the intent that actually manifests them.", "Look at the molecular structure of DNA.", "Its a long chain polymer, double stranded, with thousands of crosslinks.", "Its an unavoidable consequence of electron activity and resulting recoils in the atoms and in fact, the electron transitions routinely emit wave energies, including some gravitational at the purely atomic or baryonic level.", "Electrons themselves are the dynamic oscillators their transitions are what set the waves in motion, or capture incoming waves.", "The atoms vibrate physically as well as in EM and gravity spectra, because of the physical recoils due to conversion of energy.", "All of these are retransmitted in some way to other atoms and so on, first within the molecule and then beyond.", "SO DNA has inbuilt tendency to oscillate.", "Then if you perceive the two long sugar polymers and the crosslinks, you can see a means of resonating (tuning) the frequencies of those oscillations, because they are of fixed lengths through huge numbers of loops.", "So its like a complex tuned circuit, analogous to what you find in a radio.", "If you have electronics expertise, then look again and see the powerful analogy with a Phase Locked Loop, because DNA does indeed offer physical characteristics that qualify it very well in this regard Natures own Phase Locked Loop.", "Here are your carrier frequencies and there could be millions of them, determined by selective separation of the strands and certain select crosslinks thus changing the combinations of resonances.", "Next, you might want to look at field intensification to strengthen the signal.", "That requires coiling of the circuit.", "DNA is coiled up in three ways.", "Its primary coiling is the natural helical twist of the molecule.", "Its secondary coiling is around spherical protein complexes called Histones.", "Its tertiary coiling is the way it is wound up into more compact forms called Chromosomes.", "The signal fields I speak of are naturally intensified three ways all at once.", "The coils are coiled and the coiled coils are coiled, yet again.", "Modulating the signal outputs from this with brainwaves?", "And Doctors Poponin and Gariaev noted emphatically in their conclusions regarding their DNA Phantom Effect experiments that the Holy Grail of Physics the TOE or Theory Of Everything cannot be replete without an integration of a sound Theory Of Consciousness.", "They clearly recognise that Consciousness manifests and is influenced by energy waves.", "So we have a logically plausible explanation for such phenomena as faith healing, telepathy, NLP and The Law OF Attraction per Tony Robbins just about all of that mind power stuff.", "Ive conducted experiments in this field, myself.", "Precognition experiments were only marginally successful, and psychokinesis experiments were something of a flop, but telepathy experiments with rigid controls were nothing less than astounding.", "And others have conducted much more definitive experiments than I ever could.", "So, there is relevance at this level to healing and other interesting things.", "I have postulated the hypothesis that DNA sits at the very confluence of Biological Life and Consciousness and in addition, that its energy wave manifestation does not obey the Euclidian laws of spacetime dimensionality as we normally use them to interpret our physical reality here on Earth.", "But heres another beauty of a revelation.", "I suspect that many cutting edge astrophysicists and quantum physicists have also come to realise what I have regarding the very nature of the Spacetime Continuum, itself.", "It is not static like a solid, nor even semi-static with a certain elasticity like rubber.", "Were it so, the coherent interference pattern of the laser beam in each DNA Removed test would have decayed almost instantly.", "Look again at the DNA Phantom Effect.", "Were the vaccuum chambers in America and Russia static?", "In Moscow, the vacuum chamber was moving with the Earths rotation at about 895 kmh.", "In the space of almost a month, there was a distance travelled in circles of 300,000 Km.", "But the Earth travels around Sol at an even greater speed about 9400 kmh for a distance of about 76,000,000 Km.", "Ah, but Sol travels around the galaxy at an even greater velocity and the galaxy is travelling somewhere through space at some nominal fraction of the speed of light.", "If the Continuum were more or less static, then that tiny portion of it within the vacuum chamber would have moved beyond the chamber in a tiny fraction of a second.", "The chamber could have physically captivated and carried it, because were talking about the very medium in which matter exists what we perceive as empty space.", "Unless Spacetime were a FLUID, such that the local portion of it within the chamber just happened to be travelling along with the Earths motion.", "So Spacetime followed the earths motion.", "Ergo FLUID medium, much like the earths atmosphere, if you want to visualise an analogous substitute model that adequately fits the picture.", "This then throws up all the possible equivalent effects one observes in Fluid Dynamics expansion, contraction, density fluctuations, boundary layers, adhesion, Bernoulli Effect, Tolmien-Schlichting Waves, Eddy currents, vortices, direct interaction with matter, flow regimes, flow curvature, shearing effects and so on.", "During February of 2010, I finally got around to doing what Id intended to do with regard to contacting a Mexican hospital that specialises in cancer treatment.", "I wrote of that intention somewhere in Cancers Answers previously.", "The intention was to try to obtain information on the available types of treatment and anything they may have in the way of statistics concerning treatment results with their patients.", "I hoped to be able to compare these with stats from mainstream oncology and was pretty sure that if I actually did get any such stats, they would certainly show better results than mainstream American oncology does.", "I chose Contreras simply because it was the most widely known and probably the most reputable among the numerous Mexican hospitals (mainly located in Tijuana) that ply the American cancer tourist trade.", "Actually in all honesty, I did not entertain any great expectations of even getting a reply.", "However, on the 6th of March, I found a package in my mailbox from Contreras Hospital it appeared to contain a book.", "I took it indoors, opened the envelope and inspected the contents.", "Yes, it was indeed a book.", "Nothing else no letter or anything just the book titled, HOPE Medicine & Healing by Francisco Contreras, MD & Daniel F. Kennedy, MC (Second Edition, 2009).", "The senders address was interesting, however, because the package was sent from San Diego, California.", "It appears that Contreras has opened an Oasis Of Hope centre on the northern side of the Mexican border, circa 2006.", "Well, this is more than I really expected, I thought of actually having received a book, of all things, But it just might prove to be a lot more!", "I settled down to read it without further ado and finished reading it with the dual conclusions that it certainly was a great deal more than I expected and that I would have to write up on it in this Chapter.", "Indeed, this may well be the most important such article that is ever likely to appear in this Chapter.", "Such was the quality of what I learned about Contreras Hospital.", "I couldnt help observing (and not without enjoying the bonus for my ego) the remarkable similarity between Contreras Hospitals Integrated Regulatory Therapy and my own Holistically Integrated Cancer Strategy.", "They have some smallish differences, but so much in common!", "Begin with the fact that both are specifically designed from the ground up as comprehensive, fully integrated cancer treatment regimes intended to tackle every possible aspect of cancer and most importantly, the patient as a whole person not merely the disease.", "There are comparatively few fully integrated holistic cancer treatment systems in existence at all, even on paper such as mine far less those like IRT that are actually in full practice.", "This is more sophisticated than what I previously believed Contreras Hospital to have been doing.", "According to my perceptions, both IRT and HICS have been evidenced by the contents of this book from Contreras to exhibit certain shortcomings.", "Nothing major its just that both could be improved, each by the design of the other.", "Well, I wasted no time improving those of my own HICS, guided by what I learned from the book.", "What now remains is the converse, whereby the aspects of HICS which are not currently shared by IRT and which stand to improve it, may be integrated into IRT at some time in the future.", "Obviously, that is not something I can do it is up to Dr. Contreras and his medical staff.", "However, it is at least possible for me to present suggestions I feel are appropriate to Oasis Of Hope and this I did during late April, 2010.", "HICS now provides for the use of Ozone Therapy in the form of O3-AHT as a preconditioning regimen designed to protect a patient from ill effects of chemotherapy (if used), or indeed any cohort of anticarcinomic agents that might otherwise subject the patient to potential harm resulting from their use and especially from systemic oxidative stress.", "Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy is an equivalent pretty much the same thing, to all intents and purposes.", "Although I still feel chemotherapy is unnecessary in view of the very existence of Acetogenins, that accommodation even extends to more readily embracing the idea of using chemotherapy agents if there is a clear benefit to be had, provided that it satisfactorily adheres to Fundamental Principles in cancer treatment I set down in Chapter Two.", "Under Contreras design, those fundamentals are adhered to, because Contreras practices under the very same principles.", "It also recognizes greater value in selective high-dosage of Vitamins A, C, D & K3.", "Also on the Philosophical side of things, Contreras opened my mind to embrace a redefined concept of success in cancer treatment and the doctor, hospital, patient and support network relationship.", "Those were two more good things.", "The improvements that IRT stands to gain from the HICS model mainly hinge on using Acetogenins as the principal means of combating resistant cancers, supported with a few other agents, such as Piperine, Cantron, Alsihum and even THC.", "Acetogenins in particular represent a more decisively effective solution to the problem of resistant cancers than Contrerass existing approach.", "and might also do well to look at some additional cell differentiatimg agents particularly Burzynskis Antineoplastons.", "Inclusion of Meditation into the Emotional and Spiritual Support elements of IRT, together with a non-religious spin option designed for atheistic or agnostic patients who dont wish to embrace institutional religious beliefs to find inner strength, will also improve it.", "There are productive alternatives that are just as beneficial to atheists and agnostics as faith in God and Jesus is to Christians.", "After all, one does not wisely attempt to change a persons belief system, but instead tries to harness that persons existing belief for the better.", "Im confident the people at Contreras already fully appreciate this, but I suspect they might not yet have such a design tailored for atheists and agnostics.", "IRT might also benefit by expanding the Preconditioning Elements scope to embrace amelioration and rescue techniques in cases where people have already suffered harm from improper use of orthodox chemotherapy agents before presenting themselves to receive IRT.", "Actually, its at least possible that they already facilitate these measures, since theyd have been treating terminal chemotherapy victims from across the border in America for decades, but Ive got a beauty they could add to their rescue list Hispidulin and for that matter, Clinoptilolite is also superlative in this role.", "On the Theory side of things, IRT doesnt overtly embrace microbial infection as a distinct facet of cancer causality or treatment, but it does fully include measures that are quite satisfactorily adequate to that purpose.", "Also in theory, it does not appear to embrace an idea that resistant cancers are characterised specifically by MDRCs, or more especially, that Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) are the probable progenitors of MDRCs, thereby accounting for the very much greater aggressiveness of resistant cancers.", "And although there are strong emotional and spiritual support elements in IRT, it is unclear whether IRT includes Meditation and the teaching of it, plus hypnotherapy perhaps, in its emotional and spiritual components.", "There is mention of Psychoneuroimmunology and Psychoneuroimaging, which are not unique to Contreras and which do appear to be in the Meditation-style stream.", "Electromedicine in the forms of Infrared, Rife, Lakhovsky or GEIPE Machines is not used by Oasis, either.", "For Oasis Of Hope, it is understood that there are legal considerations where the possible integration of certain treatments into IRT is concerned.", "Inclusion of Acetogenins should not be a problem, for although not approved in the U.S. by the FDA for specific medical treatment of cancer, that prohibition can be circumvented easily enough by legitimately calling them Dietary Supplements.", "Rife Machines and other electronic means of treating cancer (or other diseases) are another matter.", "As a consequence of reading and learning from the book, I resolved to make a future attempt to open some dialogue with Dr. Francisco Contreras, who is incidentally the son of Contreras Hospitals founder, Dr. Ernesto Contreras.", "To that end, I wrote to Dr. Contreras via email, but to my disappointment, I did not receive a reply.", "Still, with Contreras now in California, to say nothing of several other integrative medicine clinics operating across the USA, the cat is now among the pigeons.", "Whole mainstream cancer research and treatment institutions throughout America must now lift their disgraceful game theyve got serious competition they can no longer afford to ignore, if only for the sake of their own declining prestige and public image.", "It even appears that two of the worst such institutions have already begun to respond in a positive way to the Integrative Medicine influence by at least embracing Complementary Medicine.", "They are NCI and MSK and whilst they still fall short of the Integrative Medicine standard, at least there are signs of improvement.", "I am almost beside myself with unholy glee from having learned of this and I want to see how it further develops over the next several years.", "One could take this book I received from Contreras as a sort of handbook about Oasis Of Hope and IRT (Integrative Regulatory Therapy).", "Ill cover it chapter by chapter, but will also note here that throughout the book, testimonials appear from fifteen Oasis Of Hope Patients.", "I have not reproduced these here.", "The final outcome of a system should be greater than the sum of its parts.", "Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy: The first component when the cells of our bodies are exposed to large quantities of oxidants, a condition called Oxidative Stress occurs and often results in tremendous damage.", "The body produces a number of natural antioxidants to try and prevent it.", "Cytotoxic chemotherapy often creates hazardous levels of oxidative stress, not only in the cancer, but also in the healthy tissues.", "OPT is intended to boost the capacity of the bodys normal tissues to withstand the oxidative stress imposed by chemotherapy.", "Exposing cells to an acute and repeated mild oxidative stress increases the antioxidant defense system.", "In Ozone Autohaemotherapy, 200 ml of a patients blood is drawn and this is exposed to Ozone and UV light.", "This treated blood is reinfused into the patient.", "The reinfused blood contains oxidised compounds, which serve as a signal of oxidative stress to the bodys healthy tissues, reflexively causing them to increase their production of protective antioxidant enzymes.", "This therapy ensures that the tissues are in much better condition to withstand the oxidative stress imposed by subsequent chemotherapy.", "That makes the chemotherapy much more tolerable and simultaneously improves the effectiveness of the chemo.", "Cytotoxic Therapy: This is the second component, which is designed to destroy cancer cells.", "Coupled with Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy, the cancer killing effects are maximised, while the side effects are minimised.", "Cell Signal Transduction Therapy: This third component uses pharmacy grade vitamin & mineral supplements and safe drugs to target cell signalling pathways in cancer cells.", "This is designed to make cancer cells easier to kill, while also suppressing their capacity to grow, metastasise and evoke the growth of new blood vessels that feed tumours.", "The term, Signal Transduction refers to the way in which cellular proteins undergo small and usually reversible changes in their structure, to induce alterations in cell behaviour.", "Genetic material in cancer cells is typically altered by mutation in ways that over-activate intracellular signalling pathways that promote unregulated growth and spread of malignancies; or that make them harder to kill by the immune system, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.", "Cell Signal Transduction Therapy seeks to inhibit these overactive signaling pathways, making cancers easier to kill and control.", "Redox Regulatory Therapy: This fourth component selectively targets tumour sites with intense levels of oxidative stress.", "The therapy is designed to attack tumour cells only and present no harm to healthy tissue.", "The combination of high-dose Vitamin C therapy (I suspect in concert with Vitami K3), coupled with Ozone Autohaemotherapy and the oxygen carrier Perftec achieves this effect.", "It can hold tumour growth at bay while boosting the killing effect of concurrent cytotoxic therapy.", "Immune Stimulation Therapy: This fifth component is designed to aid the Immune Systems ability to attack cancer by optimising the function of Natural Killer Cells and Cytotoxic T-Cells.", "The therapy employs a two-pronged approach.", "The first involves using natural products that boost the function of the Immune System.", "The second involves the use of substances that block mechanisms the tumours use to suppress the Immune System.", "Diet & Exercise: This sixth component is significant improvement with regard to diet and exercise.", "World evidence for the preventive and curative use of diets low in fats and animal proteins is compelling.", "In addition, the preventive and curative benefits of regular aerobic exercise is widely acknowledged.", "More recent research suggests these strategies may also help to slow the growth and spread of many pre-existing cancers.", "Prudent advice on diet and lifestyle is a key component of therapy at Oasis Of Hope.", "Personally I advocate some variations to the diet constituency, because fat consumption is not such a major issue, even of saturated ones.", "The Omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids are particularly important and so are all kinds of Cholesterols.", "What is desirable is to limit consumption of high GI (Glycaemic Index) carbohydrates such as Glucose, Sucrose, Wheat and Corn Starches; to maintain a healthy sensitivity to Insulin and avoid producing surplus of it (because this stuff stimulates lipid cells to convert carbohydrates into fats and plenty of exercise is a major Insulin regulator); plus good levels of endogenous antioxidants that prevent Cholesterols from oxidising.", "If Cholesterols dont oxidise, they dont precipitate on blood vessel walls and you dont get arteriosclerosis.", "These things may not relate directly to cancer, but they DO relate directly to your general constitutional health and that in turn has an important influence in the malignancy equation.", "Emotional Support: The seventh component is the development of an emotional support structure, not only at the hospital but at home, as well.", "Cancer can tax the strongest individual.", "Energy is required to learn about the illness, embrace treatment and alter lifestyle.", "It creates a need for an external emotional support system to strengthen and refresh the patient.", "No doubt, this includes helping the patient come to terms with anger, sorrow, loneliness and any other emotional states that could affect their ability to combat the disease.", "I imagine quite easily that this would involve measures to improve the patients focus on positive things, such as the love of family and friends, as well as to help assemble the right people around the patient in the form of a support network and even to show them how best to provide that needed support.", "Overall, this component has a powerful impact on the program.", "Spiritual Support: The eighth component concerns development of spiritual security.", "Theres no question that fear and anxiety produced by the spectre of death and insecurity regarding the afterlife have a significant impact on a patients overall physical and emotional state.", "Oasis Of Hope seeks to provide avenues for patients to develop the hope, peace and security that stems from a healthy relationship with God.", "This, too, positively impacts a patients ability to engage in the whole process of disease management.", "As I remarked earlier, there is no mention of equivalent strategies for augmenting outlooks of atheist or agnostic people in a spiritual sense, although since Contreras has treated many people of non-Christian faiths with similar success, there is a suggestion that they must have something appropriate for such people in their IRT design.", "This segment of the chapter also speaks of the changeability of the cancer condition, such that treatments, which work quite well initially, may not do so well subsequently.", "Therefore, the whole must be confronted from every possible direction and strategies must be adaptable to the changing conditions.", "I might also add, though once again, it is not mentioned in the Contreras text, that people who are affected by closet skeletons such as feelings of guilt will have difficulty coming to terms with combating cancer at the best possible levels until they also come to terms with the skeletons.", "Here again, the spiritual support component of IRT can make a tremendous difference.", "For certain reasons of my own, I dont separate the emotional and spiritual components of an integrated therapy.", "Contreras addresses the Emotional side separately from the Spiritual in the belief that the first comes from within, whilst the second comes from God.", "In my belief, it is more difficult to distinguish between such aspects in relation to emotion, spirituality, thought, faith, intent and the Divine.", "I believe instead that human consciousness at a certain level IS a slice of God an individualised part of a tremendous collective consciousness.", "The stuff of miracles can be brought about by joining the internal, individual Subconscious and Conscious with the greater external, collective Superconscious, through using mental disciplines like Meditation, NLP, Manifesting and Quantum Jumping.", "By doing so, such as in Prayer, for example, one can talk to the Universe (or God) and derive great inspiration.", "In simple terms, I think of the Superconscious as the Mind of the Universe and the Universe and everything in it as the Body of God.", "However, which belief system is factually correct is unimportant.", "What truly matters is that any such set of beliefs can be harnessed equally well to achieve the same designs mind over self, mind over body, mind over matter and even mind over reality.", "It is the very stuff of True Peace and of Miracles.", "This chapter goes into greater detail about the Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy.", "It indicates that direct infusion of Ozone into the body is a hazardous undertaking.", "But by infusing it into small amounts of extracted blood and allowing it to react to produce the oxides before it is reintroduced into the body, the hazards are eliminated and the oxides then do the job of signalling the bodys defensive mechanisms to produce the desired antioxidants.", "These will then serve to protect healthy tissues from oxidative damage by chemotherapy drugs in the following treatment phase called Cytotoxic Therapy.", "The procedure is repeated several times and has an excellent safety profile virtually free of side effects.", "That is because the bodys tissues are not exposed to Ozone, but instead only to the oxides produced by the Ozone.", "These are in themselves harmless, but they signal oxidative stress, so the system reacts to them defensively as it would to the Ozone itself.", "But there is something more, as reported by Professor Richard A. Lerner MD, Associate Professor Paul Wentworth PhD and their research team in a 2002 article published in the prestigious journal, Science.", "The article was titled, Evidence For Antibody-Catalyzed Ozone Formation in Bacterial Killing and Inflammation.", "Ozone may be part of a previously unrecognised killing mechanism that enhances the defensive role of antibodies, by allowing them to subject pathogens to Hydrogen Peroxide.", "This may allow the antibodies to participate directly in the killing of pathogens.", "The research opens up exciting possibilities for new antibody-mediated therapies for conditions ranging from bacterial and viral infection to cancer.", "If Ozone is indeed produced naturally by the human immune system, even skeptics have conceded this would give tremendous credibility to the concept of Ozone as a medical treatment.", "My own take on this is that the body probably does not produce Ozone within, except perhaps in the skin under exposure to UVB radiation.", "Instead, I perceive that Ozone introduced into the system will dissociate into O2 and O singlets.", "The singlets will either oxidize certain other substances in the system, or reassociate with H2O to form H2O2.", "In other words, it creates Hydrogen Peroxide.", "Furthermore, Hydrogen Peroxide IS in fact produced endogenously for example, by Vitamin C in malignant tissues.", "It is for this reason that Hydrogen Peroxide is an equivalent therapy to Ozone.", "The philosophy behind Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy is, Better prepared better armed.", "Here, I would like to add that such therapies, even by working against bacterial and viral infection alone, will have a definite effect against cancer.", "If you walk into a farm paddock and find a nice, half-dried clod of animal dropping just firm enough that you can handle it and throw it you should toss it up into the air just as high as you can.", "If it falls to the ground and goes SPLAT, youll know its cow shit.", "If you then take another clod of similar consistency and repeat the experiment, but it DOESNT come down well, thats bullshit.", "Is that really the best you can come up with after pages of fucking utter bullshit.", "No proof no papers no evidence .", "Just a book that arrives on your doorstep and hey presto .", "I shall create the ultimate miracle cure-all for everything.", "All I need is the right ingredients.", "Firstly, I will force-feed a cat with lots of citrus, mucilage, prune juice and so on.", "Very clever herbal treatment The extract from the cats valiant efforts shall become the first magical ingredient and it shall be called Catchit.", "Secondly, I shall go fishing and store the pescatori in a warm environment for oh, a week or so should do it.", "From this, I will derive the finest aromatic essences and I shall call this concentrate a Metic.", "I surely must add the rich essence yielded by wriggly things in a piece of roadkill and call it Maggik.", "Simply cant overlook going to Hong Kong, there to retrieve the exotically fragrant essence from the bilges of a Chinese junk.", "That needs a nice oriental sounding name Boo Jum.", " Then theres extract from the flower of a Supranthus tree.", "The remaining ingredients, alas, must be held secret.", "Otherwise, everybody would be making their own and I wont get filthy rich.", "But of course, everybody will want it.", "Who wouldnt buy the potion that cures everything?", "People will look at the price and think, It costs THAT MUCH?", "So when everyone is cured of all diseases, there will only be one small problem left the ungodly stink.", "The boojum is the stuff of pure genius.", "It will happily provide the solution in the form of its enlightening comments, which the bouquet of no marvel potion invented can ever aspire to rise above.", "Come to think of it, neither can anything else.", "A miracle compound of this calibre must surely have a name EUREKA DK.", "For some, the only thing that matters is the bottom line.", "With that in mind, here are some statistics provided by Contreras Hospital on their patient survival rates, repeated from Chapter 3D.", "The first set of three-year stats came to me via the Oasis publication, Hope Medicine & Healing early in 2010 and the second from the Oasis website late in 2011.", "I have reproduced only the stats of the second 5-year table here.", "They disclose figures for two Integrative Medicine institutions, Oasis IRT, CTCA IM and the USA national average from the US Seer Monograph.", "Numbers are percentage survival at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th years respectively.", "Based on the original three-year stats, I generated survival projection curves to ten years.", "When the five-year stats came in, its predictions at five years were very accurate.", "In Cancers Answers, these show as visual curve graphs.", "They cannot be reproduced here without a lot of editing.", "Oasis also shifts the perspective of patients to embrace the concept that living with cancer does not mean facing imminent death and no matter what the statistics say, reality is dictated by perceptions.", "Remember that most people who are diagnosed with cancer had the disease lingering within them for a considerable time even years before the diagnosis.", "And they probably didnt even feel particularly ill until the latter stages, prior to diagnosis.", "In some cases, they might not have felt too terrible until they were diagnosed.", "Then they suddenly perceive their world crashing down around them.", "Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift; and that is why it is called the present.", "The remainder of the books contents comprise 202 references to scientific papers and that kind of stuff, plus contact information and a DVD offer.", "Elsewhere in Cancers Answers, I have an older quote or two from Oasis Of Hopes Dr. Ernesto Contreras, I think.", "Oasis used DMSO and Laetrile in those days and reported good results, also unequivocally stating that there was nothing better than Laetrile for cancer prevention.", "However, you might have noted that DMSO and Laetrile are not even mentioned in this more current literature from Contreras Hospital, except where I inserted my own remarks about them.", "It happens that Oasis does offer Laetrile Therapy to patients who request it, but DMSO is not mentioned and I presume it is no longer used.", "Laetrile Therapy is not a standard component of IRT.", "It wasnt always legal in that state.", "I am by no means sure of the reasons why Laetrile is used and DMSO is not, but if I have the opportunity, I will endeavour to find out.", "Stool antigen for H. pylori eradication.", "Is this proof that ozone is not a poisonous gas when used correctly?", "Sweet F, Kao MS, Lee SC, Hagar WL, Sweet WE.", "Ozone forms several peroxides, hydrogen peroxide with reaction with water and lipid peroxides with reaction with fatty acids.", "These fatty acids include the fatty acids found in the cell membranes.", "The peroxides generated enter in to both healthy and cancerous cells.", "But the antioxidant enzymes in the healthy cells break these peroxides down in to water and oxygen.", "The cancerous cells though lack these enzymes and therefore can not break down the peroxides.", "Because they are not broken down the peroxides continue entering the cancer cells causing them to swell like a water balloon until they burst.", "For this reason the ozone selectively kills cancer cells, but not healthy cells.", "I was looking for this particular info for a very long time.", "Thank you and best of luck.", "Have you ever thought about creating an e-book or guest authoring on other websites?", "This thread is a great testimony to why having a *banning mechanism for troll posters* is an excellent idea.", "funny to get so angry and agitated about such things.", "what is even more funny, is that this substance does infact remove skin cancers, tumors, warts, moles, skin tags, etc.", ": D i also make concentrated cannabis oil for use to cure cancers.", "both may not work in all cases, in all forms of cancer, but that does not mean they do not work at all.", "If you would like to take much from this post then you have to apply such strategies to your won blog.", "I just started making the salve, but there are no instructions (recipe #1) for when or how to add the pine tar or the Vit.", "Does anyone know wher to reach Michele , the woman named iin the article?", "I have breatscancer and have uses black salve aswell and i agree that Back salve eats away cancer cells only I have seen this also with my own eyes.", "The trouble is like Michele also is saying in it sooo painfull.", "This is what has made me stop using for now 4 times in a row.", "I can not get to the rout of teh problemeleminated 80% or even more, but had to stop because of the pain.", "I cannot get morfine , used painkillers and cannabisoil instead.", "I really would llike to get intot contact with Michele.", "I hope to hear form you soon!", "I have used Cansema a few times.I use Colloidal silver and ant venom that is used as a pain killer.", "Where might I obtain zinc chloride?", "I am now Hepatitis b Negative (-) all thanks to MED LAB.", "Hi nice to hear your experience with salve.", "Just going through the process on my scalp.", "All is going well & just confirming the effects stingy itchy etc.", "2 WEEKS NOW so a few more to go.", "I am from united state of america, I want to testify of how i got cured of Hepatitis B, I got infected with Hepatitis B disease in 2015, i have visited several hospitals, spiritualists and pastors for cure but all to no avail, my world was gradually coming to an end until,i searched google and read about possible cures to get cured of HBsag.", "i saw a post in a health forum about (MED LAB), that cures all kinds of deadly diseases including HIV AIDS, ALS, Herpes, Diabetes MND, Epilepsy, Leukemia, Asthma, Cancer, Ghonorhea etc, at first i got shocked, because many Doctors said that there is no parmanent cured for HBsag, but when i go further i saw various testimony, about many people who got cured, that is how i give a try because this is my life, i so much believe in achieving what you desire.", "when i contacted this MED LAB via email: medlab36@gmailcom he sent me HBsag Vaccine via courier service, when i received this Vaccine, he gave me step by step instructions on how to apply them, when i applied it as instructed, i was cured of this deadly disease within 8days, I am now

This is an old treatment that is used for drawing out anything from an ingrown toenail to a splinter, but some people have used it to remove a skin cancer growth, or even a breast tumor as you will see.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes I have cancer &#8211; but I was diagnosed 2yrs ago (september 2009) and told that if I didnt have &#8216;treatment&#8217; immediately I would die.<br />\nWell &#8211; I&#8217;m still here &#8211; and healthier than I&#8217;ve been for a long time lol.<br />\nMy lump also hasn&#8217;t got any bigger for the whole time I&#8217;ve been using alternative treatment. (it initially got much bigger after they did the biopsy though and thats when it began to get painful)<br />\nTried a few different alternative treatments so far including amygdalyn (laetrile).<br />\nOne of the most effective, visual ones (one I could see physically working) was black salve &#8211; I managed to extract part of my tumour out through my skin (its usually recommended more for skin cancer) &#8211; but omg its so painful &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t recommend anyone try it without having some morphine on hand. Unfortunately it was a waste of time even asking my doctor for some because our laws prevent my doctor helping me in any way to overcome cancer using alternative therapies. (research the cancer act of 1939 -uk)<br />\nI know the black salve sounds ridiculous and if I hadn&#8217;t experienced it for myself I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it, but I found out that it was widely used many years ago for the treatment of cancer. From what I&#8217;ve seen, I&#8217;d say its probably very similar to the Hoxsey treatment. I found this online &#8211; an original book from when they used to use it in clinics:<br />\n<a href=\"http://sunwatt.mystarband.net/valueofescharotics1948.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://sunwatt.mystarband.net/valueofescharotics1948.htm</a><br />\nI&#8217;ve also recently discovered another treatment called protocell that I&#8217;m looking forward to trying. I think I&#8217;ll know within a few months if this is going to be the right one for me. Sometimes I think certain things work for some and other things for others.<br />\nThe black salve however, works &#8211; FULL STOP. (research it, youll be amazed)<br />\nHere&#8217;s a couple of examples: <a href=\"http://www.altcancer.com/products/testimonials\">http://www.altcancer.com/products/testimonials</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blacksalveinfo.com/blacksalvemov.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://blacksalveinfo.com/blacksalvemov.htm</a></p>\n<p>Of course you&#8217;ll find quackwatch telling that it doesn&#8217;t work and that it burns your skin but its not true &#8211; I&#8217;m living proof of that. Before I used it, I tried it on a bit of healthy skin for a day or so and NOTHING HAPPENED. That says it all.<br />\nI had to persist with the salve where my tumour is, and I think I had success because my tumour is actually attached to the underside of my skin and that&#8217;s why after a few applications it came into contact.<br />\nI can&#8217;t tell you how painful it was though once it started killing the cancer. I haven&#8217;t been brave enough to try it on the rest although I know for sure that if I were in a life/death situation I could get rid of it that way.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s yet another example of a cure that cant be patented so they&#8217;ll do their utmost to ban it. It&#8217;s actually been banned now for use in humans but not for use on animals so many sites have to sell it under the guise of it being for someones pet.<br />\nYou also know its not a scam when these people actually tell you how to make it. Problem is, the herbs used to make it have been banned in our country so not much chance of that. (the only chemical in it is DMSO which is used as a &#8216;carrier&#8217; to help it penetrate through the skin)<br />\nAll I can say is it works &#8211; and my family know it works so they now no longer worry about most cancers.&#8221; -Michele</p>\n<p>Here are two recipes for black salve. The person who sent me the above testimonial says some of the ingredients are illegal in the USA. I am not giving medical advice or recommending for anyone to use this, I am just putting this here for my own and other people&#8217;s information. The recipes below are from <a href=\"http://www.quantumbalancing.com/blacksalve.htm\">http://www.quantumbalancing.com/blacksalve.htm</a><br />\nI am mirroring it because it is not uncommon for sites disseminating information on natural remedies, especially ones for cancer, to get suddenly shut down or censored.</p>\n<p>Cansema Black Salve Recipe #1<br />\nOne tablespoon each of powdered bloodroot and polk root<br />\n1 tablespoon zinc chloride<br />\nDMSO (5 drops per 4 ounces of salve)<br />\nOne tablespoon Charcoal (optional)<br />\nVitamin A, 10,000 IU (more vitamin A can be added up to 200,000 IU.<br />\nPine tar (one teaspoon to one tablespoon)<br />\nPascalite clay<br />\n   Dissolve the zinc chloride in one to two tablespoons of warm distilled water. Use only enough water to dissolve. Set aside. (Be careful with this, do not get it directly on skin and keep locked from children), and do not breathe fumes.<br />\n   Mix bloodroot, charcoal and polk root in a separate container with a little cooking oil, just enough to cover the herbs, mix well. Carefully add the zinc chloride and water mixture, stirring well. Gently heat the mixture in double boiler, stirring constantly for 30 minuets Remove from heat, stir well, let cool, add DMSO.<br />\n   Next, mix one teaspoon to one tablespoon at a time of the Mennonite clay to the bloodroot mixture until you have a smooth, thick paste that is easily spreadable. Do not put too much of the clay into the mixture or it will be lumpy. If the mixture is too thick, add a few drops of oil or water to thin. If too thin, add a small amount more of the clay. The clay is important in this recipe since it helps to draw out impurities from the skin. If you do not have clay and need to make the paste right away, it can be thickened with flour.<br />\n   You will only need to apply this paste once. Apply to the cancer, cover with gauze and tape (band aids will not work), leave undisturbed for 12 hours. At the end of 12 hours, wash area with soap and water, and then clean with hydrogen peroxide. This can be applied every 2-3 days if you feel you need to, usually one application is all that is needed for very small cancers. The cancer will drop off by itself in one to five weeks. Your may have pain, fever, stinging, intense itching or burning; this is normal. You can apply some chickweed salve to the area for the itching, but do not use anything else such as healing salves. Healing salves will heal up the area before it has time to kill the cancer.<br />\nCansema Black Salve Recipe #2</p>\n<p>Cansema is a natural skin cancer treatment. The active ingredients of Cansema are Zinc, bloodroot, and chaparral. It can be ordered from Alpha Omega Labs in the Bahamas. There is a Recipe available.</p>\n<p>This is a recipe for a black paste very similar to the Cansema. But this is a preferred paste for melanoma and all suspect skin cancer like lesions. This paste also has worked well for all manner of cancers provided that they have become exposed to or close to the surface of the skin.</p>\n<p>1/2 cup powdered Blood Root (Sanguinaria Canadensis)<br />\n1/2 cup Zinc Chloride, crystals or liquid<br />\n1/2 cup common white flour<br />\n1 1/2 cup warm water<br />\n100ml Chaparral extract or 100gm of powdered Chaparral (Larrea mexicana)</p>\n<p>Pre-mix all but the water, thoroughly, before adding to the water. Using a stainless steel double boiler. Put in water, then stir in the other ingredients. Stir in well using a wooden spoon. Cook for thirty minutes over boiling water, stirring constantly. Application is much the same as Cansema. Apply a thin layer (2-3mm) of the paste over the affected area and cover for 24 hours. Then remove the covering but do not disturb the lesion at all, do not attempt to pull the cancer out at any time, it should fall out in 10 days or so. Some people with sensitive skin put Vaseline around the cancer so that the paste does not irritate the skin.</p>\n<p> DISCLAIMER: The contents of this post is for information purposes and should not be construed as medical advice.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpcnt\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"wpa-about\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/about-these-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"u\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<script type='text/javascript'>\n\t\t\t\t\t(function(g){g.__ATA.initAd({sectionId:26942, width:300, height:250});})(window);\n\t\t\t\t\t</script>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div><div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div><div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-11554789-622-581e6d9110625' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/#blog_id=11554789&amp;post_id=622&amp;origin=thetruthergirls.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=11554789-622-581e6d9110625' data-name='like-post-frame-11554789-622-581e6d9110625'><h3 class='sd-title'>Like this:</h3><div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'><span class='button'><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class='sd-text-color'></span><a class='sd-link-color'></a></div>\n<div id='jp-relatedposts' class='jp-relatedposts' >\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted in <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/category/big-pharma-2/\" rel=\"category tag\">Big Pharma</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/category/health-2/\" rel=\"category tag\">Health</a> and tagged <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/black-salve/\" rel=\"tag\">black salve</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/cancer/\" rel=\"tag\">cancer</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/herbal/\" rel=\"tag\">herbal</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/medicine/\" rel=\"tag\">medicine</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/natural/\" rel=\"tag\">natural</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/skin-cancer/\" rel=\"tag\">skin cancer</a>, <a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/tag/treatment/\" rel=\"tag\">treatment</a>.

However as 25% of medicines come from plants it is clearly a wrong assumption in the first place.<br />\nAs for the cost it is approximately $100 Au &#8211; minus the subsidy.

The research delved into the politics as well as the cures, which truly do exist (but not in mainstream medicine). What you are talking about is the political problem and Greg Caton can tell you plenty about that. (Hi Greg!) The epicentre is in the USA, where Big Pharma and the AMA have a stranglehold on medicine through just about every medical organisation you care to name, including ACS, NCI, NIH and FDA &#8211; whose senior executives are nearly all puppets on the hidden payroll. You can thank Rockefeller, just for starters. Only way to beat it is sheer weight of numbers and activism. Spread the word, that&#8217;s all.<br />\nBy the way, black salve should not be considered a cure. It may be a partial cure at best. That&#8217;s because although removal of skin tumours will help to normalise the physiology, it still doesn&#8217;t fully address the original causality factors. Unless you do this in any cancer treatment, you don&#8217;t get a cure &#8211; only a reprieve. For that reason, no single treatment such as using black salve should be expected to yield the complete result and what ought to be used instead is a multi-modal approach modelled on what is called Integrative Medicine. This should first of all address nutrition, lifestyle, detox, tissue oxygenation, infectious microbes (bacteria, viruses, yeasts etc.) and immune support in order to normalise the body&#8217;s biochemical terrain.and restore healthy homeostatic mechanisms. These things done, the body will do the rest in most cases. For the few people who need more, you get down to finer details &#8211; considerations such as drug resistant malignancies, cachexia, &#8216;low energy cancer stem cells&#8217; and so on. Effective treatments exist for ALL such considerations and problems, with the only exception being the genetic one, such as in Philadelphia Chromosome. Yes, they&#8217;re ALL natural and even genes can be inactivated &#8211; you just have to find the right agents to &#8216;switch them off&#8217;. I&#8217;ll highlight two single substances, which I personally rate as the most important metabolic cancer agents on Earth. The first is Clinoptilolite (a Zeolite mineral) because it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s second-best detox and one of only two that&#8217;s genuinely safe in what is otherwise a very tricky business; plus it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s very best anticarcinomic because it&#8217;s a totally safe and non-toxic G-phase apoptogen that causes malignant cells to fail the DNA fidelity tests during division. It modulates the p21 gene and also interacts with the p27 and p65 genes. This stuff has produced 78% complete remission in terminal cancer cases plus a further 9% extended survival in a trial with a cohort of 64 patients with various stage 3 &amp; 4 cancers &#8211; it will even cure liver and pancreatic cancers. The other is DMSO &#8211; the world&#8217;s single greatest Medical Principle. Powerful analgesic, chelating solvent, transmembrane transporter, potentiator, catalyst, antimicrobial, antiviral, oxidative agent, antiarthritic, healer and more. But there&#8217;s something even better: The Rife Beam Ray or Rife-Bare Machine. Only treatment modality in medical history ever to have yielded a 100% complete remission for all 16 terminal cancer patients in a Scripps Clinic trial at La Jolla circa 1950. Mainly, this electromedical modality works by (a) destroying infectious pathogens, which are ALWAYS involved where there is cancer; and (b) stimulating metabolic and immune function, including detox activity.<br />\nAs for the black salve &#8211; yes it&#8217;s handy and it does work. Just be careful with it. We know Stephen Barrett is an outright liar, but poke and sanguinaria do contain toxins, zinc chloride and DMSO are not to be carelessly messed with and chaparral contains NDGA, which although not toxic itself, is a potent mobilising detox compound that can cause toxaemia because it leaches poisons out of tissues, but doesn&#8217;t actively eliminate them from the body. That&#8217;s why I recommend Clinoptilolite or MCP for detox &#8211; not EDTA, NDGA, DMPS, DMSA, IP6 or any of the others commonly called detox agents. Only those two operate in all necessary detox functions independently of the liver.<br />\nCheers!</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5304\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5304\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5304\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 19, 2013 at 11:31 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5304#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5304\", \"5304\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>this is one of the biggest piles of convoluted pseudo scientific pile of utter crap I have ever read in my life.<br />\nThe Rife machine paper &#8211; published where?

Your ignorance of both that and the Zeolite trial does not surprise me. I suggest you find them, yourself. They&#8217;re not that difficult. I&#8217;m not your proof gatherer and in any case, I think you&#8217;ll theorise that they were faked in some sense or another, no matter what evidence is presented. I don&#8217;t care.<br />\nGreg is welcome to his own views and we may not be expected to agree on everything. For all I know, since we have not had discussions, his definition of &#8220;cure&#8221; may differ somewhat from mine. I am well enough satisfied that topical black salve (which is what I was specifically referring to) will eliminate whole tumours in the role of a localised epidermal/subdermal treatment. It cannot deal with metastases or really deep tissue malignancies, nor completely address causalities. That is not a criticism of it, but a perception of its limitations. Beyond that perception, there are possible (and quite plausible) theories on black salve mechanisms of action in the stream of stripping masking proteins and activating immune response which, if further research should happen to favourably indicate the likelihood of veracity to me, will further improve my estimation of its potential. I am interested in that other oral formula (Cansema III?) too. That holds promise as a more broadly systemic adjuvant treatment.<br />\nMay I quote you on &#8220;These machines are still available for hundreds of dollars and it is simply a battery with two electrodes&#8221;&#8230; No, I retract that. Consider yourself quoted, instead. Call it a return compliment, but I do think you have a Rife Machine confused with a GEIPE. Oh, but even a GEIPE isn&#8217;t anything so simple as a battery and electrodes&#8230;<br />\nNow, a Rife Machine (or Lakhovsky MWO for that matter) may take the form of several different configurations. The basic unit is a precision frequency oscillator able to produce square, sine and/or other waveforms at between 0 and 30 KHz. Modern versions are able to sweep through sequential frequency programs. To configure the most potent type typically called a Rife Beam Ray or Rife-Bare Machine, one feeds the signal from that basic unit to an audio amplifier of up to 200W. This then amplitude-modulates a high frequency carrier wave of 1 MHz to 30 MHz. 3.1 MHz is a good carrier that provides excellent signal penetration. The output is then put to a plasma globe. This is the emitting device &#8211; a rarified gas vessel much like a typical fluorescent tube &#8211; which emanates the signal predominantly as scalar wave energy. It is the Beam Ray design developed by Rife I think around 1948 that was used at La Jolla.<br />\nOh, and please don&#8217;t tell us you don&#8217;t know what detox is, what it&#8217;s purpose is or how to safely conduct a detox program &#8211; that would surely be SO embarrassing for you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5332\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5332\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray17</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5332\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 21, 2013 at 6:41 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>well in order to remove the bacteria causing the cancer I would apply an enectrical current throught the skin using a nine volt  battery.

However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans</p>\n<p>A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects, but no additional studies validate these claims. In an Alzheimer&#8217;s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation. Two older animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits, but this also has not translated into any further studies. Currently, no studies of zeolite as a cancer treatment in humans have been published.</p>\n<p>A company filed a U.S. patent application in 2001 for a synthesized form of zeolite as a cancer drug . Data submitted were based on in vitro, plant, and animal studies. The patent specified that the substance must be injected directly into the tumor, which rules out any benefits by oral route. In addition, the FDA has issued warning letters to several Internet distributors of zeolite products for misleading claims about health benefits</p>\n<p>Zeolite can affect brain serotonergic receptor activities of mammary carcinoma-bearing mice, but the clinical implications for humans is unclear. Zeolite supplementation did not prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals</p>\n<p>Zeolites are carcinogenic when inhaled.There are no published studies investigating the purported antitumor effect of zeolites in humans. Large prospective studies have demonstrated that inhaled zeolite is carcinogenic, and responsible for a well-described epidemic of malignant mesothelioma in Turkey</p>\n<p>So thats pretty much that taken care of&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;as for the &#8220;Rife trials &#8221; &#8211; a study almost eighty years ago . I wonder what cancer they had and how it was shown? Ultrasound? CT scan? Killing the &#8220;viruses&#8221; that caused cancer??<br />\nI was aware that new trials were on going but presumably if they are on going they havent been done yet. Still it will be much more interesting when cancer can be seen and recorded.</p>\n<p>charlatan? The last time I saw anything as thick as you it replicated by dividing itself in half. Its interesting you go very quiet on subjects when it is pointed out that you have no basic understanding of what you are talking about.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t put arsenic in food you thick fuck it is a trace element.  Carbon dioxide is a poisonous gas &#8211; try an atmosphere of it &#8211; it is how they slaughter pigs in many countries. The fact is you have no understanding of basic concepts.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid that lack of insight is not the same as being impervious to criticism &#8211; many paranoid delusional schizophrenics exhibit the same symptoms.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-6460\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-6460\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5a72c439f0de1a8ef525873acd42dbe5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Jill</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-6460\">\n\t\t\t\tNovember 14, 2013 at 6:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=6460#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6460\", \"6460\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Jill'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Rosemary Pustak died 22/3/2013<br />\nSo no need for a reply</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-2554\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-2554\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3decf10f87f7da1438aa0465e944d3e6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://breastfeedingbasics.info' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Jessica</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-2554\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 7, 2012 at 5:32 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=2554#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-2554\", \"2554\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Jessica'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>This is so important. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen first hand, also how eating asparagus daily can have an impact on cancers, as a loved one has been eating it to reduce his skin lesions.

I agree . . . it is why in Meditopia, I refer to the suppression over the past 150 years as the &#8220;Great American Medical Holocaust.&#8221;  Tens of millions of people who have perished at the hands of people like Michael Murray with their ridiculous chemotherapy and radiation modalities could have been saved were it not for the suppression of work like mine, or R.R. Rife, Wilhelm Reich, Nathan B. Stubblefield, William F. Koch, Nikola Tesla, Gerson, etc.</p>\n<p>Michael Murray says he wants proof.  He is absolutely insistent that we haven&#8217;t provided any.  Nonsense.  I provide a plentitude of proof in Meditopia and my other online material, but he says that doesn&#8217;t count because I RESEARCHED IT, WROTE IT, and POSTED IT.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I have no way &#8212; with the present tools that are at my disposal &#8212; of proving that the world is round.

And if we apply the logic of Michael Murray, none should have the audacity to suggest that the earth really IS round. </p>\n<p>But let us presume that I DID want to prove that the world is round.  The simple fact is that at the end of my pursuit I would have produced no more convincing an argument than I could that Cansema &#8212; or any other properly prepared escharotic &#8212; cures skin cancer better than 99% of the time . . . and a great many internal cancers at lesser percentages of success.</p>\n<p>This the big problem &#8212; as Thomas Sheridan makes clear in his work (&#8220;Puzzling People: The Labyrinth of the Psychopath&#8221;).

I have never asserted online or in Meditopia that anybody was using chemo or radiation therapies in the 1800&#8217;s &#8212; which have seen their real accrescence since 1950&#8217;s.  Nor have I ever asserted that the use of chemo and radiation therapies alone are responsible for the runaway cancer rates we see today. I believe that modern technology &#8212; natively maladaptive to normal human functioning as it is (read the work of Dr. Rene Dubos) &#8212; has provided an onslaught of cancerogenic inputs that we are only beginning to appreciate. A good example of this is the work of Samuel Milham (M.D.) in &#8220;Dirty Electricity :  Electrification and the Diseases of Civilization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But whoever you are (&#8220;Quack Journalist / . . blah blah blah&#8221;?), I believe the larger issue related to your post is form.

This is false. Or eating asparagus will cure cancer either. This is clearly just utter crap.  What happens to the cancerous growth ? it just dries up? or indeed the &#8220;internal cancers that you claim that your tablets treat &#8211; does a renal cancer just &#8220;get passed out? Extrude through the skin? Urinated out? The notion is physiologically impossible yet  you claim that I dont understand physiology. Something having an physiological effect  does not equate for normal people to a cure for anything. What is the bioavailabiity of the cansema capsules ? Do you know ? What &#8220;internal cancers&#8221; are you talking about? How do you know the long term survival? Do the people that die write in and tell you?<br />\nThese are perfectly valid questions which you will simply refuse to answer and create another excuse which I look forward to seeing &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>\n<p>Max Gerson did not treat anyone . Once again your personal statements are utterly meaningless as you sell crap for a living , are a convicted liar and will provide any rubbish to try and justify your cause.<br />\nHis clinic has killed several people from electrolyte imbalances, salmonella from unclean equipment and colitis by infusing coffee enemas.<br />\nBut like you he  claimed they were all out to get him, provided not a shred of proof and set up in a third world. </p>\n<p>You should really make up your mind what causes and what cures cancers. Gerson asserted it was sodium imbalances, then your other quacks thought it was a lack of orgasms, or a lack of vitamins, or an excess of sodium and need a pint of coffee up their ass with a raw liver smoothie (Gerson)  or just &#8220;toxins&#8221;  and can be treated by massaging or sexually abusing children( Reich &#8211; who thought his father was an alien) giving injections of distilled water,( William F Kock) or using the Rife machine ( which was recently available on a certain persons website for only $400 &#8211; and consists of a 9 volt battery and two electrodes.)</p>\n<p>Proof is not hard to get.<br />\nIf you want proof the world is round look at the moon. if it has a crescent shaped shadow on it then it must mean that something round is blocking the light from the sun &#8211; that would be the earth,<br />\nProviding proof in medicine is much easier. You have people with evidence of a diagnosis. That means in most conditions pathology.<br />\nYou give them treatment and then follow them up for a time and see what happens &#8211; easy peasy.<br />\nYou dont see patients just sell jars of potions. You dont know what they have or what happens to them. You offer no logical explanation as to how tumours can be selectively killed or not and how they leave the body without defying normal physiology.

Hmmm?  Who?  Who one this blog ever asserted that eating asparagus &#8212; by itself &#8212; cures cancer?  Can you tell me?  Who?  You don&#8217;t know the difference between an adjunctive therapy or primary modality, do you? Show me where I ever said that that practitioners were using chemo or radiation therapy in the 1800&#8217;s.  Never happened, genius.  You are going to keep saying it, of course.  But it never happened.</p>\n<p>What I DID say is that the general pattern of suppression of effective cancer curing remedies since the 1800&#8217;s has prematurely MURDERED tens of millions of people.  You&#8217;ll never agree to that, of course.  But everything I have experienced in my professional career in the alternative health care field over 30 years confirms it.

There is a REASON why people of your ilk resist &#8220;Evidence-Based Medicine&#8221; as I make clear in Chapter 4 of Meditopia (www.meditopia.org).</p>\n<p>Cansema cures cancer.  You would have the many thousands of people around the world who have reported their positive results ignored if the person making it doesn&#8217;t have an officially-sanctioned explanation as to the mechanism of action.  This is bullshit.  It&#8217;s why people don&#8217;t accept the official version of much of anything anymore.  People trust their own experiences and when they are an eyewitness to their own cure, you feel that you &#8212; the Almighty God that you are and your friends in the Orthodox Medical Community &#8212; should have the power to veto what people are an eyewitness to.  This is just nonsense.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to address the rest of your letter because it is a regurgitation of things we have already debated. You jwon&#8217;t address my comments or posts &#8212; so why should I waste my time taking your &#8220;SAT tests&#8221;?  You don&#8217;t want to believe that Middlesex Hospital announced a cure for cancer in 1858 and did a clinical study with over 4,000 patients.  You want to rewrite history, as do all tyrants who don&#8217;t want people believing in things they don&#8217;t like.  Tough. It happened, and I cite my sources in Meditopia.  You press the issue of follow-up, as if 4,000 people wasn&#8217;t enough in the original study.  What follow-up?  What more follow-up do you need to this multi-year study?  As anyone been able to REFUTE the results?  Of course not.</p>\n<p>You insist &#8212; in every one of your posts &#8212; on asserting that I&#8217;m a fraud, as if there isn&#8217;t a mountain of evidence to support my contention that modern, orthodox medicine isn&#8217;t the very epitome of fraud. I suppose you think that I have paid off the hundreds of people in Australia who are working with Panacea-BOCAP and are collecting a mountain of clinically valuable data to support my claims . . . none of them using fake data &#8212; the kind you see in JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>\n<p>No matter what I say or who I quote, you have to take issue with it.  I understand that.  You have no other recourse.</p>\n<p>This blog was set up by Truther Girls to report on two approaches to skin cancer that are consistently curing this ailment.  One of those I am connected to; the other I am not.  I find it curious that you would devote so much time to a blog that is &#8212; by its very existence &#8212; something you are labeling as fraudulent and untrue.  </p>\n<p>Have you noticed yet that not a single person who has used Cansema or other black salve variant has come on this board to say that it didn&#8217;t work?</p>\n<p>Oh &#8212; I forgot &#8212; it couldn&#8217;t have possibly happened the way they described.  Everybody is a liar if their outcomes don&#8217;t have your approval.</p>\n<p>Too bad.

He was able to show that statin drugs are a complete fraud on the public.  And he came out with his studies in 1991 &#8212; at a time when statin drugs were already pumping in $150 billion a year in revenues.  I provide extensive detail in Chapter 4, Section 4 of Meditopia.<br />\n( 2 )  Veritas Magazine.  I have never been in contact with anyone who works for or is associated with this publication.  In fact, I received the PDF copy of the article only AFTER it came out &#8212; from a trustee who works for Panacea BOCAF.  You pulled this one out of your rear . . . and you have no evidence to the contrary.

Primarily, they serve to rigidify cell plasma membranes, particularly in zones called &#8220;rafts&#8221; where influx/efflux proteins, signalling proteins and whatnot are mainly embedded. They provide binding between phospholipids and proteins.<br />\n(2) The real culprits are not cholesterols &#8211; not even LDLs. Instead, they&#8217;re oxycholesterols and the LDLs figure more prominently because they are the ones that oxidise more easily. Oxidation renders them less soluble, so they precipitate as plaque on vascular interiors.<br />\n(3) Inhibition of them by statins is harmful &#8211; not beneficial. Cells with inadequately reinforced membranes are inherently &#8220;weak&#8221; and may also manifest failure by cells to retain their plasma proteins properly.<br />\n(4) Statins also inhibit CoQ10 production and this is even more seriously harmful. This vital endogenous antioxidant in its Ubiquinol redox state is what keeps the blood vessels clear of plaque. When it is depleted, there is little to prevent cholesterol oxidation and what little cholesterol may be left for the system to use properly is much more likely to oxidise and precipitate in the vessels and perhaps also the heart, instead. It effectively doubles the risk of heart attack, rather than reducing it.<br />\n(5) Once Ubiquinol CoQ10 has scavenged a pair of oxygen radicals, which it may have done from oxycholesterol to become Ubiquinone CoQ10, it probably migrates into cells, where it participates in the ETC as part of the Mitochondrial Complex I in which ATP is produced. So CoQ10 is vitally important and statin drugs BLOCK the stuff. That&#8217;s dangerous.<br />\n(6) Nobody who is breathing, and I mean absolutely NOBODY &#8211; should be using statins. Keep up the CoQ10 instead &#8211; Ubiquinol for clean blood vessels and Ubiqinone for energy production.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5335\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5335\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray17</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5335\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 21, 2013 at 7:27 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I think two cents would be a gross ecomonic over estimate.<br />\nYou just demonstrate you are a clone without an original thought once again.<br />\nYour explanations are clearly wrong and you are speaking about physiological processes you dont understand.

So, on the topic of (escharotic) black salve, I&#8217;ve had one brand since the early 90&#8217;s. Once this runs out, the &#8216;veterinary only&#8217; stuff looks good too. Over the years, a friend and I have used it several times for small -and not so small- red irritated patches that don&#8217;t go away. It&#8217;s still very potent! Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found: It has always done what it claims. Yes it hurts, not so bad for small stuff, but, say, penny sized and more, WOW! The instructions aren&#8217;t kidding: &#8220;manage your pain&#8221;. However, I don&#8217;t take anything for the pain. Mind you, it&#8217;s impressively painful once &#8216;the process&#8217; peaks. Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen the quackwatch picture, it&#8217;s gruesome! (She did NOT have the genuine stuff! Read the article) So, what did I do? Last year I put some on a nickel sized red patch on my nose. My face didn&#8217;t melt like that poor woman in the picture, but it was quite intense! Once again, it worked just like it says. Not for the timid or fearful! I will always have this stuff around. I definitely make no medical claims, non-chemical sunscreens are our friend, and your are responsible for your own not-approved-by-doctors health knowledge journey. All the best!</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-3681\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-3681\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/808c8c18151f69fad342ca012ed21810?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Missy</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-3681\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 8, 2012 at 9:27 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=3681#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-3681\", \"3681\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Missy'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Isn&#8217;t it possible that it&#8217;s the zinc ingredient that is doing the work?

This recipe is a legitimate one, although I would personally leave out the Glycerine because it&#8217;s hygroscopic. The zinc chloride will already do plenty of that because its hygroscopic, too. Note that contrary to popular belief, glycerine does not moisturise &#8211; it de-moisturises, because it soaks up water and does not easily release it. DMSO is more than just a transdermal carrier &#8211; much more. In fact, it is directly anticarcinomic in its own right and dramatically potentiates other compounds into malignant tissues by almost a thousand-fold versus what healthy tissues would receive. In addition, it accelerates biochemical reaction speeds &#8211; said to be by a thousand-million to one. It is a powerful analgesic that works by blocking nerve signals, but initially produces a strong heat sensation for ten to fifteen minutes. I think it activates the nerve system&#8217;s heat sensing channels and then depletes the acetylcholine, leaving the area numbed &#8211; much like capsaicin from jalapeno. It have not yet tried it, but intend to experiment with repeating DMSO applications through the paste or scab without otherwise disturbing it, to ameliorate the ongoing pain problem. Graviola is rich in Acetogenins, which are lactone lipids. They are self-potentiating in malignant cells, because they have very high binding affinity with Ubiquinone Oxidase, a cell membrane enzyme unique to malignant cells. It&#8217;s not found in healthy ones. Actually, I suspect UO is also present in bacteria, but I won&#8217;t go into the rationales for that. Acetogenins actively inhibit Mitochondrial Complex I, the process of ATP production. For this reason, they are particularly good against multi-drug resistant cancers and also multi-drug resistant microbes. They practically shut down the p-glycoprotein efflux pumps that resistant cells or bugs use to get rid of cytotoxins. They cause the mitochondria to release apoptogenic caspase enzymes, too, so in these ways, they cause the deaths of cancer cells with minimal or no impact on healthy cells, depending on the cells&#8217; energy requirements. Some Acetogenins are incredibly potent &#8211; there are two in Paw Paw (Asimina Triloba) with EC50 ratings against prostate cancer cells of less than 1 attogram per millilitre, marking them as the most potent selective apoptogens known to medical science. Those are Trilobacin and Asiminocin. The most notable one in Graviola is Annonacin &#8211; somewhat less potent, but still quite powerful. Sensitivities of different cancers to different acetogenins vary widely. One could even choose to use Goldenseal in one of these recipes. It contains the alkaloid Berberine, which is also a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor with many useful applications against microbes and malignant cells, including resistant ones. Galangal is similar to ginger or turmeric, so it has a range of anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant and anticancer actions including Cox-2 inhibition. Bloodroot contains a toxic alkaloid called sanguinarine. Poke contains toxic alkaloids phytolaccine and phytolaccotoxin. Chaparral contains NDGA, a potent chelating toxin leacher/mobiliser. Bentonite or montmorillonite or pascalite clay will absorb toxins and also thickens the mixture. Charcoal does both likewise, while flour is mainly just a thickener. The zinc chloride raises the pH and may have other effects.<br />\nBasically, a good black salve formulation will exhibit several distinctly different anticarcinomic actions ranging through pH modification, Cox-2 inhibition, mitochondrial complex I inhibition, g-phase apoptogenesis, caspase activation and so on; and is designed to work as a dermal exiguent that kills and draws out the tumour.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-3803\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-3803\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9a4b2a29fd7476d32f8501aa02f770df?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://gravatar.com/mynameis1' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>mynameis1</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-3803\">\n\t\t\t\tAugust 23, 2012 at 9:51 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=3803#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-3803\", \"3803\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mynameis1'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Black salve hurts because it burns your skin, this much is obvious given the large gaping holes people are often left with. any sane doctor would prescribe surgery instead of this method of burning cancer off.

Always want to make sure it heals up, even if there is a scar, there is also with surgery. My father had a new nose from 4 surgeries on his nose, because they could never get it all.

Black Salve is used by some Vetrinary establishments in the US and as I know it it is not illegal to use it on yourself. It&#8217;s been around for well over a hundred years. You can get yourself cut,burnt and poisioned if that is your wish. We are taught from a very early age to run to the Dr. when we are sick so this is the normal reaction for many people, but there are alternatives that are 100% effective.

Having grown up as a &#8220;California Girl&#8221; baking in the sun all of my life, I am now dealing with massive basal cell cancers and melanomas.  My sister deals with squamous cell cancers.  I have used the salve to extract the cancer and it&#8217;s roots on more than 25 occasions over the years, the latest being a melanoma on my arm.  During this time, I would occasionally go to a dermatologist who would cut out cancers from the sensitive areas (such as the nostrils), only to have the cancers return.  I would then use the black salve and it would be painful, yes, but it took the cancer away with no returning.  At this point, I will not ever go back to a doctor to have cancer cut off me, I only use the salve and with fabulous results.  </p>\n<p>After looking at Quackwatch&#8217;s gruesome photos, I have come to realize that the swatch of skin that is missing from the woman&#8217;s face has been surgically removed (the clean straight edges show that it was cut away surgically).  Now I&#8217;m sure she probably used the black salve incorrectly, and as such, had a huge eruption and ran to the doctor who then removed all the skin across the face and then took the photo and claimed &#8220;look what the black salve did&#8221;.  Hmmmm&#8230;&#8230;..funny how during the turn of the century, the U.S. had &#8220;escharotic hospitals&#8221; where the black salve was used to treat cancers, then they closed them in lieu of modern medicines pharmaceutical treatments and suddenly our cancer death rates started to soar.</p>\n<p>I recommend the black salve 100%, however, everyone who is using it for the first time needs to have an experienced user guide you through the process and show you how to use it correctly and responsibly.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4087\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4087\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">michael murray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4087\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 1, 2012 at 9:07 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4087#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4087\", \"4087\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to michael murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Where is the proof for &#8221; cancer rates have begin to soar?&#8221;&#8230;. you do know what proof is?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5306\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5306\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5306\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 20, 2013 at 3:57 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5306#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5306\", \"5306\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Good comment, Lydia.

Michael Murray doesn&#8217;t work in cancer research.  I know this because no one who is serious about cancer research would make so many glaring misrepresentations as I have seen here.  I have associates who disagree with me on a variety of things and our discourses in sharing those disagreements do not affect our mutual friendships.  But Murray is clearly not educated in alternative cancer therapies.  He is a proud member of what naturopaths call the &#8220;burn, poison, and slash&#8221; crowd. </p>\n<p>If you read through the now very lengthy thread above, you will see that Murray is very motivated when he posts here.  He has no objectivity, and is here only to bad-mouth something he knows nothing about.  He doesn&#8217;t like the video that Truther Girls posted, so he is here to criticize it.  He has not the background, training, or expertise to comment on the properties of escharotic preparations.  His only capability is to criticize it and dilute valuable insights of other contributors with his spam.</p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t even consider the many testimonial submissions from conventional medical doctors that you find on the Cansema testimonial pages (linked from <a href=\"http://www.altcancer.net/cansema.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.altcancer.net/cansema.htm</a>).</p>\n<p>You cannot reason with Murray or hold a civil conversation.

Childhood leukaemia had a death rate in the 1960&#8217;s of approaching 100% is is now around 10%. There is a physiological basis for how it works.<br />\nSkin cancer with the exception of high risk melanomas are not treated with chemo or radiotherapy  but surgery so why drug companies are afraid of losing a market share that doesn&#8217;t exist is simply beyond understanding. I am well aware of corruption in the pharmaceutical industry and is a consequence of business and medicine colliding.</p>\n<p>I have no problem with people using whatever treatment they wish &#8211; but they should have some basis in reality. This story  is attempting to create an entirely new physiological process where cells somehow become mobile, move and migrate through tissue and stick to a chemical compound. Is it seriously suggesting a large tumour would simply end up outside the body stuck to a lump of corrosive paste?<br />\nMost &#8220;alternative&#8221; treatments are harmless and most have been proven to do nothing &#8211; but there is a real danger when a desperate person follows this and ends up &#8211; as in the case series in the American Dermatology journal &#8211; having reconstructive surgery that harm has been done because people were not provided with a realistic and honest explanation.  Sadly the USA has more of this alternative health care as they are the only country in the developed world to not provide basic healthcare as a matter of right and so people resort to extracting their own teeth, smoking dried up plants and any cheaper or home made remedies.. Im not sure this should be the real definition of &#8220;alternative&#8221; &#8211; as it makes it sound as if some people have a choice.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4109\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4109\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/55e0182ae606aa9c741265afccf6f458?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Bridget</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4109\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 2, 2012 at 7:54 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4109#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4109\", \"4109\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Bridget'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>You can read Ingrid Naiman&#8217;s book Cancer Salves.

What is stated above is that cancer cells will migrate out of the body &#8211; this is a new claim. There is no need for big money research &#8211; aspirin is still extensively investigated and most research can be done by simple observations. and it comes from a plant so cant be patented so no one would be interested in it anyway Saying it works is not proof &#8211; neither is personal testimony. Otherwise,any claim for anything to treat any condition remains completely unverifiable.  I was simply asking for proof.<br />\nSo I assume you believe that cancer comes out of the body aka The Green Mile&#8221;? I am simply adding a little intelligence to this in case someone misdiagnoses themselves then applies a potion and subsequently dies of breast cancer.

Forgive my lack of technical terms but for internal tumors such as breast cancer, it goes something like this: The salve makes a hole. It&#8217;s not magic, it&#8217;s painful.  More salve is applied. The salve makes a scab inside. More salve is applied. The salve works its way in towards the cancer.  It is a physical, painful process. It is not magic. For whatever reason (not magic, I assure you, most likely something to do with the ingredients in the salve, which unfortunately has not been scientifically researched or explained YET) the scabby mess works its way out through the wound. There is leakage of pustulent matter afterwards. It&#8217;s not pretty. It&#8217;s not painless. It&#8217;s not magic. But it takes the cancer out.

How does it get to the abnormal tissue and how would it know to destroy abnormal tissue and how does it heal?<br />\nIs there not a risk that of someone has nodal involvement that this would be missed?

Which cancers or is it all? When virtually all skin cancers are treated with surgery where is the evidence that &#8220;big pharma&#8221; wants to prevent curative treatment when the cure rate for non melanoma cancers is practically 100% without any resort to chemo a the moment. Are you saying hey are trying to protect a  market share that doesn&#8217;t exist?<br />\nLastly please print any evidence it works- it has been used for hundreds of years before modern surgical techniques so there should be plenty&#8230;.<br />\nHaving no credibility with people who believe in unproven witchcraft and you insult anyone who challenges them is a good thing. It might just stop h possibility of someone with a melanoma dying who would otherwise live.<br />\nAnd regarding  concern for my well being- are you not doing exactly the same thing?!<br />\nHowever if you can&#8217;t or aren&#8217;t willing to answer the questions an apology would be a suitable alternative&#8230;.

So being told repeatedly you are stupid &#8211; repeatedly-by someone who is struggling to  construct a sentence is highly amusing.<br />\nAnd loving terra &#8230;.  Such aggression . It is highly common for people who have no answers to straightforward questions to simply insult and run away. My friend has a melanoma &#8211; on his retina and on his liver. Presumably by rubbing this on it should disappear.<br />\nThe original poster said she rubbed it on her skin and nothing happened but only when it went through the skin was so painful it required morphine.  The receipe stated &#8220;may experience burning &#8221; several other posters described the pain on application . She also said her family weren&#8217;t worried about most cancers because of this &#8211; ? Really ? Lung cancer , bowel cancer , leukaemia ? Conveniently enough her cancer is near the skin. She still went to get it diagnosed properly and then took proprietary medicine for the pain. Other people here seem to be slapping it on anything without having a diagnosis . You can&#8217;t say you are treating skin cancer &#8211; there are lots of different types &#8211; unless you have had it biopsied . But if you choose to believe one poster who said &#8221; I just knew it was cancer&#8221; &#8211; you might want to think again before calling other people stupid and mounting your broomsticks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4124\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4124\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Michael Murray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4124\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 3, 2012 at 1:41 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4124#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4124\", \"4124\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Michael Murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>And Joe ( capital J &#8211; take note) please don&#8217;t tell me I am stupid again&#8230;.

I just find it very difficult to understand and I have a fair degree of understanding of pharmacology and physiology. A salve is a chemical paste. It does not really seem plausible or logical that it can target certain types of cells by an unknown mechanism. The concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; against cancer cells is not new and has been sought for years. It is stretching imagination to think it can create a hole by killing health cells, cauterise blood vessels to not cause bleeding,  directing towards a tumour , destroy cancer cells, extrude any waste material then allow healing and complete closure all by an entirely unknown and unrecognised mechanism.<br />\nThe notion that this has not been looked at is not plausible as virtually every cellular step and chemical has been examined. One study in South Africa in 1990 suggested that only cancer cells were targeted but this has not been able to be replicated.<br />\nThere have been many reported cases of burns from the use of salves and in one case in Australia a man who developed a fistula by applying the salve to his abdomen. It is obviously a corrosive chemical compound. They have been banned in the USA and Australia for making unsubstantiated claims as to their cancer killing ability. in order to make these claims you need evidence and they did not provide any. The danger of making a patients own salve is that the strength will not be guaranteed. Im afraid I find the evasive answers that it is too expensive to do research or there is no money in the compound as it is made from natural resources or from plants is simply not true. Capsacian ointment was made from an extract of chilli and clearly this is a plant and did not require a patent to be taken out on the plant.<br />\n40 % of Americans take alternative health care products or supplements and spent around $20 billion . I suspect a great deal of the aggression aimed here I suspect is from people with a vested interest simply posing as interested posters.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4137\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4137\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/55e0182ae606aa9c741265afccf6f458?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Bridget</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4137\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 4, 2012 at 11:13 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4137#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4137\", \"4137\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Bridget'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>There are different ways to make it. Zinc chloride is the more corrosive ingredient. Some salves include it, some don&#8217;t. I personally have no vested interest. I found the idea intriguing, and a little scary.

However on speaking to several physiologists, pharmacologists and physicians none had any understanding of how a simple mixture could have behaved could behave in such a way. Collectively to perform all these actions in a way unknown to science and unrepeatable in a laboratory with no single piece of evidence published is frankly impossible. The chemicals and compounds have been tested. The suggestion that it seeks out cancer cells which you cannot explain , no professionals have explained or witnessed and is not reproducible in anything other than two scientific papers </p>\n<p>The active ingredient in many of the salves is Sanguinarine from blood root amongst others. Two studies have been published 20 years apart regarding its anti cancer properties. One in 1990 on its effect on dermal cell lines and the other in 2010 on prostate cancer. cells so its effect has been looked at.<br />\nThey have very specific actions on limited cell pathways as all chemicals do . It has been suggested that it may be a potential cancer treatment in the future. However many compounds are . The effect on cell lines is often not translated to effect in either animal or human tests.<br />\nIt is interesting that almost exactly the same claims are made for cannabis oil for treating everything from skin tumours to systemic tumours . Again all these chemicals and compounds have been looked at in spite of having been examined and have pharmacological effects but this has not been translated to clinical effectiveness.<br />\nZinc oxide  has no topical use and is water soluble so would have difficult being absorbed through the skin. &#8220;Contact can  cause severe irritation, skin burns and ulcerations. Solutions are corrosive. Symptoms include redness and pain.&#8221;<br />\nAgain it just seems that for any compound to have such a miraculous ability and then for the actual ingredients to not actually matter just is incomprehensible</p>\n<p> However she has a vested interest as she has a fairly extensive book list, diplomas , counselling sessions and directed healing which are also available (including astro medicine at many hundreds of dollars per session),I think it is also unlikely that if the compounds are known ingredients why she would be approached or why research would not go ahead without her. Again this could simply be an unsubstantiated claim. It seems highly unlikely that if the proprietary salves could substantiate their claim they would have legally made a fortune. if it was me I would have gone all out for a share of the billion dollar market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4154\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4154\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5468cebfd06205fa4f2de5782c76d9c2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Tibby</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4154\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 9, 2012 at 5:22 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4154#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4154\", \"4154\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Tibby'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>obviously Michael hasn&#8217;t spent time online watching testimonials as they are very compelling&#8230;.  my best friend was diagnosed in July with breast cancer and was dead in 3 months under the best treatment modern medicine could offer.

You have a corrupt inefficient health care system which does result in huge numbers of personal bankruptcies. Both of these facts doesnt make a magic paste work. If she had widespread cancer even the most optimistic &#8220;alternative&#8221; treatment or salve user would suggest that applying it all over would somehow have sucked out all the cancer.<br />\nAs for melanoma it cannot be shown to be a melanoma until it is removed and looked at under the microscope. Otherwise you have no proof that you are treating a melanoma in the first place. How would a &#8220;salve&#8221; remove all the spread of the melanoma from all over the body?<br />\nIm afraid I have watched some of the &#8220;testimonials&#8221; &#8211; they are completely unverifiable. Stories. I have seen testimonials that there were WMD in Iraq, Presidents didnt have sexual relationships with women,  that people were abducted by aliens, had interactions with Bigfoot&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.it doesnt provide any evidence. If you find them convincing I can only assume you are easily convinced. For all the time they have been around a sesnbile person would ask for one shred of evidence rather than provide excuses as to why it cant be done.<br />\n if you would prefer to use them for conditions you havent got and presumably would be able to prove you had them without biopsy knock yourself out. But even on this page it adds it isnt medical advice. Im amazed at how little people need to become an MD.<br />\nHowever the bottom line is that with no proof you are potentially leaving vulnerable people to increase their chances of dying.<br />\nThe very beginning of this imaginary tale she states that she also used laetrile &#8211; she really needs to keep up as this was thoroughly discredited over thirty years ago in at least two trials and a meta analysis &#8211; this is what happens when you test hockum &#8211; it tends not to work &#8211; hence the resistance to doing it</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4163\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4163\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://i0.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/614947204/picture?q=type%3Dlarge&#038;resize=48%2C48' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/michael.murray.357622' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Michael Murray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4163\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 9, 2012 at 10:43 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4163#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4163\", \"4163\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Michael Murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>It is corrosive to normal skin &#8211; the people on here cant even seem to agree to that . it is simply impossible for something to make a hole in healthy skin and create an inflammatory reaction without destroying normal skin to gain access.<br />\nThis is really twisting reality to suit your argument.

People who have used black salves for cancer and experienced the results just _want other people to know about it_. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say. Probably. But just for fun I&#8217;ll add that my great-grandmother, when she was ninety years old, developed a painful growth on her lower back and it started to affect her ability to walk. She directed my grandfather and grandmother to find different plants, and poultice them on her back. They changed the poultice every few days. After several weeks when they changed the bandage, the growth came out and it had what looked like roots. That&#8217;s just a family story. My great-aunt took the growth to the doctor but he didn&#8217;t  tell her anything about it. Doctors in those days were not the first place one turned when sick. My great-grandmother lived many more years after that. </p>\n<p>So you speak to your people, who can&#8217;t accept it, and I speak to mine, who can. I don&#8217;t know what more to say.

There are many people like one mentioned above who do sell it along with recipe books and spiritual healing. The recipes for homoeopathy are widely available and free and they have been shown not to work.<br />\n Nor are unverifiable folksy stories about grandma.<br />\nIt is simply a chemical paste or varying ingredients and strengths  does not have the power to wonder through the body destroying tissue , clearing cancer and magically closing up a hole it created in the first place.

Its not preferable it is essential.<br />\nThe fact is that the market for &#8220;alternative&#8221; treatments in the US runs to around $30 billion, Lots of people make a lot of money, 60% of Americans dont believe in evolution and a fifth dont have health care .

Someone will try and treat a melanoma with a home made acid cream and die .

I am not here to advocate anything just new solutions that work better. You aare basically saying that the way things are in medical institutions are totally healthy and are doing a great job of healing the cancer patients. this is where we disagree.  you basically think that where we are with medical treatment in our society is great, and everybody (your statistics and percentile rate above) prove that we have indeed mastered the cure for cancer. Yes or no? is this what you are saying? When society stops evolving and medically cures stop progressing and people who are the victims to these diseases fall prey to the medical services provided as much as you think they are civilized and super advanced; are really not. thats the point. We as humans need to continue to challenge ourselves and to put on the table the reasons why we are failing in this cancer department. If u cant find fault with the medicine used and fight those that are trying to evolve or medicinal society at large then you are just part of the problem yourself. you can defend this all you want but at the end of the day being content with the medicine we have today will not benefit the advancement for medicine tomorrow. So as long as you keep defending the present medical standards and how they are basically curing people with your &#8220;statisitics&#8221; then you are defeating the purpose of evolution,despite your intense claims of modern medicine doing such an efficient job, there are In 2012, about 577,190 Americans are expected to die of cancer, more than 1,500 people a day.<br />\ngo check it  out.You&#8217;re lack of concern is disconcerting. I feel sorry for you, maybe you should be a caveman and live in a rock since you hate the concept of man actually taking steps forward to find new and more efficient cures. this is my main point of your obsessive arguing and passion for the status quo in our fight to find real efficient healthy medical treatment for the future of mankind. if you want to blabber on then go ahead you obviously have a bone to pick with anyone who tries to post anything  to advocate new solutions and are perfectly happy with the amount of people dying since you don&#8217;t want to change anything.

The groups would have to approximately equal in demographics.  Both groups would have to be followed up for long enough \u2013 five years is usual and then mortality, complications, cost, acceptability were measured.<br />\nEnough people would have to be recruited to demonstrate that the difference was statistically significant. In the case of skin cancer you would have to decide whether you were looking at squamous, basal , melanomas or Kaposi.<br />\nThis isn\u2019t contentious. This is just the way things work.<br />\nClaims that there is an  pro cancer conspiracy are just that. Stats published this week showed that mortality from skin and bowel cancer have halved  since 1970\u2019s, breast cancer mortality  had fallen from 50% to less than 15%.<br />\nNotions that cheap cures are not wanted seems to be against the research into aspirin and bowel cancer. This will not make money for any drug company or doctor.</p>\n<p>Is the current system perfect?  &#8211; far from it. However turning one self into an oncology/ pathology  expert on the basis of reading a blog by someone who claimed to have been helped by something is not remotely sensible and frankly dangerous.<br />\nThe initial claim  is unverifiable ,She  has a superficial tumour which we see no evidence of.  As the tumours originate in  the glandular tissue and not in the subcutaneous fat this seems very suspicious. She doesn&#8217;t claim it is cured &#8211; it just &#8220;hasn&#8217;t gotten any bigger&#8221;. She uses laetrile which was in fact tested and meta-analysed and was shown to be ineffective and potentially dangerous. The website then has a disclaimer that it is not offering medical advice. So collectively this being read by the easily impressed would at first reading seem plausible when in fact is nothing of the kind.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4264\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4264\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1eda329af936a97a12ced8bb44077d07?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Wigwam</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4264\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 23, 2012 at 1:45 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4264#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4264\", \"4264\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Wigwam'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Thank you for your rational advice. A friend has just died from cancer. She had a lump in her breast a few years ago that was at an early stage and could have been treated with conventional oncology. I have to assume she was skeptical/cynical of conventional treatment. She went on to treat herself with Black Salve and claimed to have cured herself, and did seem fine for a couple of years. As a result of not being in the medical loop, she would not have had regular tests (ie MRI&#8217;s, etc) to make sure the cancer had gone. After losing weight, and various other symptoms, she eventually had tests to discover the cancer had metastisised into other parts of her body&#8230;..bones, lungs. She went to Mexico to the Gerson Clinic for six wks. She came home ten days ago and died yesterday morning. I have to accept that she made up her own mind with regards to the treatment she felt comfortable with and that is every human&#8217;s right. She was a vibrant, very attractive, intelligent, well read and respected woman. She was also mother to a young boy, an only daughter, an only sister, and adored by her husband and friends. I can&#8217;t say for sure that conventional treatment would have cured her, but looking at the evidence, I think she may have had a better chance because she found the tumour at an early stage. Her death was no less agonizing for her at the end regardless of choice of treatment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4263\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4263\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/41464c918ab6c42715870165823bffc9?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://mibobekot.wall.fm/link/3' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Vaughn</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4263\">\n\t\t\t\tDecember 22, 2012 at 4:22 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4263#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4263\", \"4263\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Vaughn'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I&#8217;m guessing you don&#8217;t mind me visiting and saying thanks to you for your<br />\npost &#8211; it really helped</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4291\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4291\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/de71c54167765f0391f1b1f937b3398b?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Godsendization</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4291\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 1, 2013 at 7:30 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4291#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4291\", \"4291\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Godsendization'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>If a person can see with their own eyes what has happened to them, then what has happened is their reality.

In response : we routinely ship our salves to Russia, Ukraine, and Belaria . . . with much less frequency to other former Soviet satellite countries &#8212; probably because the language issue becomes even more acute. (The majority of our materials online are in English.)</p>\n<p>Thank you for the kudos . . .  it&#8217;s most thoughtful of you . . </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like responses to some of the more substantive questions surrounding this entire issue, which The Truther Girls were kind (and bold) enough to bring to light, let me know.  My mentor, Dr. Russell Jordan, was himself the co-founder of two successful pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. (as I recount in Chapter 1 of Meditopia) and through him I was able to learn a great deal about suppressed remedies spanning centuries. It&#8217;s a difficult thing to be accomplished in your field and only discover at the end of your career (and life) that this very field is incorrigibly corrupt and beyond repair. Intellectually, this was Dr. Jordan&#8217;s gift to me at the end of his life.</p>\n<p>About becoming a distributor &#8212; we no longer encourage it, because in our primary markets, it just sets up good-hearted people to have to go through what we experienced, and we don&#8217;t wish that on anyone.</p>\n<p>The U.S., in particular, is quite challenging, as I make clear elsewhere (<a href=\"http://www.meditopia.org/chap3-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meditopia.org/chap3-1.htm</a>).  It may no longer be the land of the free.

I can record an audio and send it to you free of charge.</p>\n<p>Greg, yes the language is the issue, I created blog in Russian where I put info on alternative cures. I don\u2019t have much time to translate everything, so I put links to English resources and give brief resume in Russian. Poor people start writing me and asking where from they can buy an alternative herbal medicine. I do point them to your website and few others, but of course they asking for translation. I wonder, do you plan to make a page with your products in Russian? There are more than 300 million people speaking this language. I am willing to help in translating though I do work full time. I guess you will face the same issues for Chinese language and alike.

But I am glad you dont disagree with anything on it.</p>\n<p>This is all standard fare .. I believe there was over 150 fake cancer cures censored by the FDA. Now either yours is the only one that works and are just unlucky or just bear with me &#8211; people sell products which dont actually work as people with cancer get desperate.<br />\nI am aware of the secret league across the world of 10 million doctors in every country hand in hand with every drug company , university department and research scientist to hide the cure for cancer and presumably they would risk their own death and those of their loved ones to protect profits&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;thats probably it . </p>\n<p>The fundamental question is do the salves work?

Lumen Food Corporation advertised products via an Internet website <a href=\"http://www.altcancer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.altcancer.com</a> under the name of Alpha Omega Labs, located in Nassau, Bahamas. These products were advertised as containing medicinal qualities for the treatment of cancer and many other diseases.<br />\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Gregory CATON, President of Lumen Food Corporation, and his employees utilized Alpha Omega Labs to take direct orders for these unapproved new drugs. The chemical substances were not approved for sale by the FDA. As a result of the scheme, CATON received approximately $950,000. In order to legally market a drug in interstate commerce, the drug&#8217;s manufacturer is required to comply with all applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in order to ensure that the products sold are safe for humans and effective for their intended uses.<br />\nOn at least two occasions known to the FDA, the items shipped by CATON&#8217;s firm and used by consumers resulted in bodily injury and harm. The products were Cansema Tonic III and H3O. Cansema Tonic III was advertised for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of cancer. H3O was advertised for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of athlete&#8217;s foot, cuts and burns, eczema, fingernail fungus, chronic gas, gastroenteritis, gingivitis and periodontal disease, halitosis, herpes sores, ophthalmia, psoriasis, sore throat, strep throat, and wounds. CATON did not have an Investigational New Drug (IND) application on file with the FDA.<br />\nOn September 17, 2003, a federal search warrant was executed at CATON&#8217;s residence, Lumen Food Corporation, and an industrial site owned by CATON. All of these locations were in Lake Charles, Louisiana.<br />\nDuring the search of CATON&#8217;s residence, a cache of weapons was found consisting of three semi-automatic rifles, one bolt action rifle, two shotguns, a semi-automatic pistol, 10, 252 rounds of amunition, three body armor vests, leg armor and two bullet resistant helmets. The weapons, armor and ammunition were found concealed in a hidden compartment that was inside a closet. CATON was arrested on possession of firearms by a convicted felon.<br />\nNumerous misbranded and unapproved new drugs were seized during the search at Lumen Foods, as well as items deemed as hazardous materials by chemical engineers. Also seized were (16) sixteen (55) fifty-five gallon drums of a liquid corrosive material at the industrial site owned by CATON. This liquid was subsequently identified as sulfuric acid and was mislabeled as non-corrosive. All of the hazardous materials seized were subsequently destroyed by a hazardous materials disposal company.<br />\nOn May 26, 2004, CATON was convicted of violating Title18, U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 &#8211; Mail Fraud; and Title 21, U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(d), 355(a) and 333 (a) (2) &#8211; Introduction into Interstate Commerce of Unapproved New Drugs. CATON also forfeited (2) two buildings and his residence in Lake Charles, Louisiana.<br />\nOn August 24, 2004, CATON was sentenced to (33) thirty-three months incarceration to be followed by (3) three years supervised release.</p>\n<p>Only fair for people to see what kind of kind caring person you are &#8211; the kind that has body armour assault rifles and 10,000 rounds of ammunition</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4352\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4352\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4352\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 17, 2013 at 12:01 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4352#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4352\", \"4352\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>It appears that someone has learned to &#8220;cut and paste&#8221; from U.S. government websites.

Do they really work and are they really effective? . . . or . . .   ( 2 )  Is this a elaborate hoax or mythology that has been perpetrated on the public by a handful of people who are just trying to deceive the public . . . for fame, profit, or some other ignoble purpose?</p>\n<p>The establishment would have you believe the latter . . . only they are loath to explain why I give away the formulas for free &#8212; (I have generated more competitors than I care to count) &#8212; why YouTube now has hundreds who provide pictorial evidence of their cancer cures &#8212; and why Big Pharma&#8217;s solutions to cancer treatment continue to be obscenely high-profit chemotherapy, radiation, and invasive surgery, despite the fact that their success rates are abysmal. Embarrassingly abysmal &#8212; which is why there are so many millions of people looking for alternatives in the first place.</p>\n<p>Anything that doesn&#8217;t directly address this fundamental question is misdirection.  Nothing more.  There is no other question that is more central to this discussion.</p>\n<p>ONE LAST THING . . .  I don&#8217;t know who LovingTerra is, but I just clicked on her link and it appears to be a site in Russian.  Yes, yes, I know &#8212; now I&#8217;m an agent from Russia, I suppose. </p>\n<p>We Russians are setting up bases of operation all over Ecuador!

The clinical studies that preceded the initial 1858 Middlesex Hospital announcement involved over 4,000 successful cases &#8212; all using one of Cansema&#8217;s predecessors.</p>\n<p>It is extremely rare for me to see a skin cancer case &#8212; or even one that is close to the skin &#8212; that is not effectively removed with a properly prepared escharotic. My own career began with Dr. Russell Jordan&#8217;s clinical studies in Mexico using the &#8220;zinc chloride / chapparal&#8221; embodiment that cured over fifty cancer patients with no recurrence.  Why can&#8217;t you find these studies in medical journals?  For the same reason that someone as celebrated as Nobel-Prize winner in Medicine, Dr. Linus Pauling, couldn&#8217;t get his last studies published in ANY medical journal in the mid-1990&#8217;s, because they proved that statin drugs are unnecessary and a sham &#8212; at a time when statin drugs were already grossing over $150 billion a year.  Dr Matthias Rath, M.D. launched his career as a result of witnessing this atrocity.</p>\n<p>What is amazing isn&#8217;t the lack of clinical results that show that escharotics work. What is amazing is that there are so MANY cases proving it works and the establishment is so good at suppressing it. Meditopia explains how the system operates, so that the &#8220;Mikey&#8217;s&#8221; of the world are seen for what they are.</p>\n<p>Greg</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4366\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4366\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdm</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4366\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 20, 2013 at 11:37 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4366#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4366\", \"4366\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdm'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Greg ,</p>\n<p>Meaningful &#8211; are you having a laugh?<br />\nOnce again I am not sure if you are able to read properly.

He simply tries to sell vitamins as medicines making unproven outlandish claims &#8211; a little like yourself.</p>\n<p>Five trial participants stated in sworn affidavits that they were stripped to their underwear, photographed, and had blood drawn without their permission. They were told to take pills containing what were said to be high doses of vitamins, including Rath&#8217;s VitaCell. Demetre Labadarios, who leads the Human Nutrition programme at Stellenbosch University, questioned the safety of administering high doses of supplements to already-sick patients.[</p>\n<p>During and immediately following the vitamin trials, &#8220;many people died,&#8221; deaths attributed by Rath&#8217;s adversaries to a lack of effective medication..Sanco-Rath clinic workers reportedly instructed patients to return to the clinic in the event of medical emergency, rather than going to hospital</p>\n<p>Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer (SKAK), an independent group which evaluates alternative medical treatments, examined Rath&#8217;s vitamin preparations and the marketing claims made by Rath.[31] The Study Group reported that they &#8220;found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr. Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer.</p>\n<p>And a trial in 1858 ? Are you really serious? Pre antibiotics/ anaesthetics in infancy ? Published where? Randomised? Controlled ? Followed up ?

I have no idea who you are or who you work for . . . though &#8212; much like &#8220;Mike Murray,&#8221; you are a faceless poster who comes on to the scene with a very obvious agenda.  And like Mike, you seem to relish propagating provably false information.</p>\n<p>Escharotic preparations are incredibly cost effective. I can&#8217;t speak for others, but we ourselves sell Bloodroot Paste for $10 a jar.  It can be used on multiple lesions.  Yes, a large clinical jar of Cansema DOES cost $59.95, but this can be used to treat an entire room full of people with skin cancers . . . with MULTIPLE GROWTHS.  Compare that to a trip to the dermatologist which can run $100.</p>\n<p>Concerning your &#8220;thesaurus&#8221; jab : I don&#8217;t use one.  Perhaps neither nor Mike can appreciate that some of us have sufficient command of the English language such that grade school language aids are no longer necessary. Your combined attacks remind me of an old saying I heard when I was a teenager with a short-lived affection for billards:  &#8220;If you can&#8217;t shoot good, shoot hard.&#8221;  You can&#8217;t address the massive evidence I present in Meditopia &#8212; which machine-guns the reader with hundreds of verifiable footnotes.  You are impotent to come to the table with meaningful counter-arguments, and so you resort to childish personal attacks &#8212; all of which I address fully in Meditopia.  You are like 5-year-old kindergartner children, whose only response to a classmate&#8217;s criticism is &#8220;I know you are, but what am I.&#8221;  You don&#8217;t have the intelligence, grasp of the relevant facts, or cerebral resourcefulness to elevate the conversation so that other participants on the thread can ask the right questions and come to their own truths, so what do you do?  You work assiduously to drive the discussion into the mud so that there is no meaningful discussion at all.</p>\n<p>The ribbing about the Middlesex incident in a case in point. You criticize my ability to draw from clinical studies that were published in the 1800&#8217;s &#8212; when physicians commonly knew that few things do a better job of making cancers metastasize than cutting into them surgically &#8212; as if a timeless truth is somehow diminished with time. Strangely, these studies were conducted well before it was common practice for pharmaceutical companies to rig clinical studies &#8212; a ubiquitous, scandalous, insidious practice that has even been cited by the New England Journal of Medicine. </p>\n<p>You are all ABOUT negating the facts and the real evidence. The suppression of legitimate cures is why Truther Girls did their video on this subject in the first place!   Obfuscation is your goal.  It is your mission.  It is your assignment.  Just like Stephen Barrett and Quackwatch, which has been thoroughly discredited.</p>\n<p>I have news for you.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re losing. As more and more people come to realize that conventional medicine is, at best, about maximizing profit, and at worst, about eugenics, your tactics are becoming increasingly impotent.  There is an obviousness to what you are doing that more and more is only escaping the village idiot.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mind valid criticism. If I make a statement that can be shown to be incorrect or misstated, it SHOULD be corrected. That&#8217;s part of a healthy exchange. </p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re here for.</p>\n<p>And just like &#8220;Malignant Mike,&#8221; you&#8217;ve been marked.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4380\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4380\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdm</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4380\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 22, 2013 at 10:30 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>If  you wish to be corrected you may find this helpful regarding your misunderstanding regarding surgery spreading cancer.<br />\nFactors affecting the spread of tumour include the age of the patient, the location , type of tumour, genetics, race, vascularity, proximity to blood vessels and lymph glands, chemotactic factors, haematogenic growth factors,  tumour necrosis factor levels, nutritional status and a host of tumour v host interactions.  Surgery is not what makes tumours metastasis.  If this was the case resection of metastatic tumour would be universally pointless  &#8211; I believe Lance Armstrong would be testimony to this being false.  This wasn\u2019t known by doctors in the 1800\u2019s as it isn\u2019t true now and the understanding of cancer was primitive. In the 1840s asepsis was barely used, there was no histology, and few microscopes . There were practically no anaesthetics , no antibiotics and no adequate pain killers. Most surgery was simply done by holding a patient down and using amputation or fairly blood excision. Suggesting that an acid paste was better than amputation is hardly a revelation. It is not however proof it is a superior efficacious treatment in the 21st century<br />\nTo imply that doctors would not exaggerate or manipulate their results to gain more patients is quite na\u00efve.  Doctors were paid by patients.  The only country where patients pay for their treatment directly is the USA so your comments about payment are not relevant to every other developed country. A paper  -which has now turned in to an incident \u2013 involving 25 patients &#8211;  which a doctor treated 4000 patients \u2013 equivalent to almost 30,000 based on todays population seems extreme in the least. I can find no record of this anywhere only your own reference in your own publication to a book. Hardly concrete.  It would not have been proven treatment as the diagnosis could not be proved and it was not comparing anything and I doubt there was any follow up. In short the whole example simply borders on the ridiculous.  A paper/ incident   apparently unreferenced by a presumed honest doctor who knew all about a pathological process which doesn\u2019t exist from 170 years ago. It is utterly absurd.<br />\nI have no doubt he used it especially if the alternative was excision without anaesthetic. However trying to manipulate this into evidence for a theory that surgery spreads cancer is simply utterly false and should be retracted. You clearly have no medical pathological or physiological knowledge and are simply making up facts to justify your medicine. </p>\n<p>If a large bottle of salve can treat a \u201croom full of people \u201cthen why on earth do you sell it?</p>\n<p>This is not \u201csuppression of real cures\u201d and the battle is not mine to lose. I don\u2019t make a living selling medicine that is not proven to work. Cancer survival rates have almost doubled in the last thirty years or in the case of childhood leukaemia gone from virtually nil to over 90%. This is proven , documented and reproducible, audited, monitored internationally organised for rare tumours and coordinated. The very notion of extracting internal tumours by plant chemicals that only target cancer cells is physiologically impossible and utterly fantastical.</p>\n<p>As for the volume of references in Metotopia they are simply all quotes from a range of practically identical general knowledge books and cancer conspiracy theories.  Nothing from any journal or institution of repute.<br />\nPlease don\u2019t flatter yourself \u2013 you haven\u2019t \u201cworked with\u201d 20,000 patients \u2013 you simply delivered a jar.  No response again for anyone else would not be evidence.<br />\nYou are simply encouraging self diagnosis and treatment for your own profit not for anyone elses benefit. Lets not pretend any more.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4384\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4384\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4384\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 23, 2013 at 1:43 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I originally responded to this board because a customer asked me to.

I say this to reinforce the fact that I appreciate knowledge, and education.  We all have health insurance, and I carry supplemental cancer insurance, in case we should ever need it, with traditional medical treatments.  I am going with my 26 year old son this week to have a recommended colonoscopy.  I am very thankful for the medical community here in the U.S.  My fathe-in-law, and my husband have both had SKIN cancers surgically removed, (non melanoma).  They have since then used &#8220;black salve&#8221;  on numerous skin cancers, both medically and self- diagnosed, with great success.  I have watched first hand the processed and it works like others have reported above.  They have both rubbed the salve on self-diagnosed &#8220;non-cancerous&#8221; skin, with absolutely no effects.  They have reported the pain is intense, especially on larger spots, when the &#8220;plug&#8221; falls out, it does leave a substantial hole, but they heal up beautifully, in fact, better than some of the surgical scars.  I haven&#8217;t personally tried it, but I have seen the results first hand.  You can&#8217;t see the wind either, but you can&#8217;t deny it&#8217;s results.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4375\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4375\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4375\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 22, 2013 at 1:22 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4375#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4375\", \"4375\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>&#8221; Noname&#8221; &#8212; your experience is universal.

He was a non educated salesman who sold salves . He published books of garbage.  He gave his evidence to the authorities and there was no evidence of efficacy. As it harmed people and there was no proof of effect ( sound familiar) he relocated to a neighbouring country. When he developed cancer he tried his own treatment and it didn&#8217;t work. Then he took conventional therapy.</p>\n<p>In 1950, Hoxsey submitted case histories of 77 patients to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), claiming that they were &#8220;fully documented with clinical records and pathological reports&#8221; and that they would demonstrate his treatment&#8217;s effectiveness. However, the NCI found that of these 77 reports, only 6 included actual tissue biopsies. Of the 2 biopsies from patients described by Hoxsey as having &#8220;internal cancer&#8221;, neither showed any evidence of actual malignancy. The NCI concluded that Hoxsey&#8217;s records did not contain sufficient information to evaluate his treatment. Hoxsey argued that it was the NCI&#8217;s responsibility to seek out the information necessary to verify his case reports, and attributed the failure to do so to a conspiracy on the part of the NCI and AMA</p>\n<p>Now  I am not sure if you are a distant relative or can you see any association at all?</p>\n<p>Old wives tale/no proof/ makes money/ gets closed down/ relocates to third world/ its a conspiracy&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>\n<p>Anything yet?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4397\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4397\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d61ed7562d6d2bd59ba53cc0811047ee?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Steve</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4397\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 23, 2013 at 9:01 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4397#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4397\", \"4397\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Steve'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Please people don&#8217;t even respond to mikey, he has an agenda and just wants to engage you to further it.

I&#8217;m fair skinned, middle aged, and 3 of my siblings and my mother of had melanoma so I take these things seriously. I asked my internist to remove or biopsy it, he wouldn&#8217;t (Im in an HMO and they are reluctant to do procedures or refer), advised me to try using wart remover and said it was just a keratosis. It was unsightly and itched so I tried the wart remover, it didn&#8217;t work. In searching online I came across this b/s info so I ordered and tried it. It took 3 rounds,but finally it&#8217;s gone and I just have a small indentation where it was instead of a quarter sized lumpy growth. </p>\n<p>I do not say this substance is a panacea for whatever ails you, but it DOES draw out and remove irregularities. It is not comfortable to use, should be used cautiously for sure. But naysayers need to realize many people don&#8217;t have insurance or money for doctors. It is very hard to even get into a dermatologist in the U.S., unless you&#8217;re paying cash and going in for botox or fillers then you&#8217;ll be seen.</p>\n<p>Follow the money. If big interests pockets are threatened they will bring the hammer down, using taxpayer funded agencies as their personal enforcers. </p>\n<p>I can understand an individual wanting to warn people to &#8216;be careful&#8217;, being concerned about public heath, but don&#8217;t understand this campaign to demean people&#8217;s genuine personal experience. </p>\n<p>I also urge people to use prevention first, use nature&#8217;s anticancer weapons, organic vegetables and spices, and use a physical block sunscreen, because cancer treatment is all about slash and burn, and the treatment often causes secondary cancers down the road so best to just prevent it if you can.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4412\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4412\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc4e7a4c7139554ce49e5c2cf6f781ae?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">bgraceg</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4412\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 26, 2013 at 11:17 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4412#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4412\", \"4412\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to bgraceg'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>And also when people criticize individual MDs for not suggesting this or another &#8216;alternative&#8217; treatments, in U.S. physicians are hogtied by overseeing agencies and not to mention potential lawsuits.

Countless physicians have confided to me that they are tired of being forced to use expensive, ineffective treatments because they have a knife over their throat.  If they use an effective alternative, they risk the loss of their license. One close personal friend, Dr. Leonard Smith, was an internist in Gainesville, Florida, and in the 1990&#8217;s he treated several people successfully with our Cansema and ended up with a $43,000 fine from the Florida licensing board.  He was an internist / surgeon with a highly successful practice.  After that, he just couldn&#8217;t do it anymore.  He gave up his practice, closed shop, and became a medical consultant.  Few physicians have that kind of moral backbone, but they all know what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<p>Another friend of mine, Steve, was living in Minneapolis when he finished his internship.  He couldn&#8217;t continue, because &#8212; as he told me &#8212; &#8220;I would never have begun medical school in the first place had I known that we&#8217;re just drug pushers.

Acid paste?  Just what acid are you talking about?  Is it the NDGA (nordihydrogauaretic acid) in the Larrea, which is less acidic than tomato juice?  Is it the zinc chloride, which has a pH around 5.0? . . . .   Hmmmmm . . .  can&#8217;t be the Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) because that&#8217;s alkaline.  In fact, there are 60 alkaloids in the bloodroot that, together, contribute to the escharotic process. Are there any other herbals that contain hydroquinones that you don&#8217;t like?  They&#8217;re not acidic, but &#8212; hell &#8212; let&#8217;s call them acidic anyway because it sounds good. Purified water . . . now maybe that&#8217;s the acid you&#8217;re talking about. since you&#8217;re being so ridiculous.  It&#8217;s usually closer to 6.8 &#8212; not 7.0 . . .  </p>\n<p>Have you ever worked in a lab?  Do you even know the difference between acidic and alkaline compounds?  Do you even know the average pH of well-made escharotic?</p>\n<p>Murray . . .  you have no knowledge about escharotics or their successful history of use.  None.

You&#8217;re like Toby McAdams with BloodrootProducts.com who &#8212; for years &#8212; got away with falsely saying that we were putting sulfuric acid in our Paste, just to smear us . . . never mind that no maker of escharotics I have ever known in my life has ever used a harsh acid &#8212; organic or inorganic &#8212; to make their products. My wife and I have treated over 20,000 cancer cases successfully . . . the majority of them being skin cancer, as skin cancers comprise the largest single class of cancer cases. We have hundreds of documented cases on our web sites, many of them detailed pictorials.</p>\n<p>What is the establishment&#8217;s response to this?  What&#8217;s the best they can come up with?  I will tell you.  A scam artist named Sue Gilliatt, who in June, 2004, admitted in a sworn affidavit that she intended to work with the FDA to destroy us BEFORE she even received any of our products.  She admitted under oath that after using our products, she no longer had cancer.  She admitted under oath that she was in it for the money.

You simply make stupid statements that either defy the laws of physics/ physiology or hide under the &#8220;its all a huge conspiracy- Im the only one that tells the truth &#8211; and for a man with a colourful past that takes a bit of swallowing.</p>\n<p> It is acidic &#8211; that is why it is corrosive. 6M Zinc Chloride has a ph of 1. This is why is it refered to as a corrosive substance. Your fantasy statements bear no witness to reality. The &#8220;woman &#8221; allegedly reporting the use it strangley named both your product and your website &#8211; now there is a coincidence. She also refered to having morphine hand for the pain. Pain from what? How does an inert substance burn through skin?

I detail this in Chapter 1 of Meditopia (www.meditopia.org).</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Veritas Magazine (Australia) did a magazine article on our work in their Jan./Feb. 2013 edition. It quotes the work of an organization called Panacea that has collected hundreds of case studies, with medical reports and extensive documentation showing that Cansema cures cancer.  One of their trustees sent me a copy.

The TGA (Australia&#8217;s equivalent of the U.S. FDA) ORDERED Nirvana Anderson to take down her website where she was RELATING her positive experiences using Black Salve.  She was NEVER in the business.  She was only an END USER.  We have now entered a new era in health care where it will now become increasingly difficult to even DISCUSS our experiences with one another . . .  So much for freedom of speech.  We should enjoy the opportunity to talk to one another now, because we will not be able to do so much longer. Big Pharma realizes that it cannot win this battle, based on the facts.  Their only option is to ensure that none of us can talk.</p>\n<p>This parallels the worldwide attempt to make owning a firearm illegal.  People need to get the connection here.  If you take away a man&#8217;s right to protect himself, you are one small step away from taking away a man&#8217;s right to express himself.  There is a reason why the U.S. Bill of Rights is constructed where the Freedom to Bear Arms immediately follows Freedom of Speech.  People have lost their appreciation for this connection.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4467\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4467\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/591de999280237eaac874fb4ae459ebd?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">peacefull warrior</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4467\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2013 at 1:19 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4467#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4467\", \"4467\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to peacefull warrior'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>TGA by the way operates under the pretended laws, they are NOT REAL LAWS, people of australia are f..d by Commonwealth Australia CORPORATION, registered in USA, they are not the same as Commonwealth Australia of People, all &#8220;profits&#8221; (Australian taxes) are going to &#8220;shareholders&#8221;, check this video:<br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/umVj5XQYAi8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4468\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4468\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray...........d..not t</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4468\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2013 at 2:48 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4468#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4468\", \"4468\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray...........d..not t'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>In 1948, Mohs publicly renounced the use of escharotics without accompanying surgery, claiming that it caused excessive mutilation and was an unreliable cure</p>\n<p>It should be clarified that Mohs used zinc chloride only as a fixative and Sanguinaria only as an organic stabilizer for his fixative paste. The primary procedure undertaken by Mohs was surgical excision</p>\n<p>So is he a quack &#8211; absolutely not . Do I need to rethink my position &#8211; absolutely not.</p>\n<p>Lets recap &#8211;</p>\n<p> Mohs performed surgery. He developed a technique to be as minimally invasive as possible. He used pathology to establish a diagnosis. He followed up his cases as reported on survival and recurrence. He used a mainly zinc chloride paste as a preservative for the tissue as frozen sections were not available. When better techniques were used he adapted. and left unwarranted techniques behind..He did not use pharmaceutical agents and nor are they used today.The current techniques allow for a cure rate between 94 &#8211; and 99% for non melanoma skin cancers. He published extensively in peer reviewed journals and his pathological specimens were inspected for diagnostic accuracy.<br />\nThe reference you provide does not mention blood root only zinc chloride paste. </p>\n<p> In 1978, Tromovitch and Stegman demonstrated that in situ fixation with Mohs surgery was not essential and that a similar cure rate of BCC could be obtained with fresh frozen tissue sampling</p>\n<p>In short he did NOT recommend escharotics, self diagnosis , no follow up . no peer reviewed publications and did not claim 100% success of any skin tumour let alone bone tumours or bowel tumours. He did not and no one does today use chemotherapy agents for non melanoma tumours.<br />\nMany of the people posting here have recommended frankly dangerous activity under a banner of pseudoscientific garbage  and pretend conspiracy to justify their own greed for profits.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4469\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4469\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4469\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2013 at 3:10 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4469#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4469\", \"4469\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Michael . . .  as with nearly every post you have made, you present us with a cavalcade of misstatements.  No one that I know in the alternative health care field says that they anything 100% of the time.  Even with skin cancers, Cansema does not work in about 1% of all cases.  This 99% success rate drops precipitously with inner cancers.  Taking into account the large number of people who come to us, for instance, after chemo and radiation have brought the patient to the edge of death and irreversible cachexia, there are some cancer types for which we are successful only 50% of the time.</p>\n<p>I provide more detail in the use of an escharotic preparation in Moh&#8217;s in Chapter 1 of Meditopia (www.meditopia.org).  Zinc chloride was only one of the active ingredients; Sanguinaria canadensis root being another.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t ever talk to me about greed.<br />\nYou dare to mention greed when the average American losses over 80% of their lifetime assets in the last 60 days of life with completely useless therapies.  You dare to mention greed when most pharmaceutical companies have way over a 2,000% profit on &#8220;cost of goods&#8221; as a standard part of their business model.  You dare to mention greed when health care costs are out of control and Americans are coming in last in health care outcomes?  Orthodox medicine is the epitome of greed . . . and anyone who has objectively studied the subject knows it.</p>\n<p>If I worked with the kind of profit margins that are routine in the pharmaceutical industry, I&#8217;d be a billionaire by now.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4471\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4471\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray...........d..not t</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4471\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2013 at 5:39 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4471#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4471\", \"4471\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray...........d..not t'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Greg &#8211; you have been asked no less than three times to provide answers to direct questions and you have refused to do so mainly as you are a professional and convicted liar.<br />\nI have provided no false information.

However there is no world wide plan to ban guns although only an imbecile would encourage firearms as way to maintain freedom of speech and security.<br />\nChildren in America are four times more likely to be abused , most  likely to die than other developed countries and more likely to be obese.  One in three women experiences domestic abuse and one in four children sexual.This fantasy about protecting your family is a convenient excuse to maintain a gun fetish . In  reality a child is killed or wounded every few hours.<br />\nThese arent difficult concepts . You have developed a paranoid , gun fetish/ culture where some people of limited intelligence use catch  phrases like &#8221; our guns are there to overthrow the government &#8221; &#8211; and presumably after committing treason they would then have to establish their own government.

This must have missed most people.<br />\n Most countries do not have issues with firearms. Most enjoy more freedoms of expression and a better longer fitter life than most Americans. It seems rather contradictory to connect free speech and liberty with having the ability to kill people.<br />\nLets look at reality. there are 290 million guns in the US, It has one of the highest murder rates in the developed world. Most are by firearms. Every decade there are over one million people injured or killed by firearms. Having a gun in your home means you are four times more likely to be killed or injured during a burglary. For very justifiable homicide there are another twenty related killings from accidents, domestic abuse and suicides..Most guns used in crime are stolen.There is a direct correlation between the level of gun prevalence and of gun crime. Gun crime takes two yeas of the average American life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Because of the poverty, social inequality, racism, prison industry and the lose interpretation of the constitution to suit a multibillion dollar gun industry and the political impotence to try and improve the situation it is unlikely it will improve. However most countrlies in the world manage free speech without bearing assualt rifles to express their opinion</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4472\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4472\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4472\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2013 at 5:40 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4472#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4472\", \"4472\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Michael . . .

The smallest was about 1/8&#8243; on the side of my nose.  The largest was about 2&#215;3&#8243; on my upper chest.  I&#8217;ve noticed 2 distinct responses.  One kind rarely gets bigger than a quarter, usually dime-sized, always has one black center surrounded by an ashen gray zone and comes off clean.  The other looks like black pepper sprinkled on cigarette ash, always has very irregular borders, is always big, and always bleeds, sometimes quite a lot.  I think these are more like clusters of tiny tumors.  My salve came from a woman here in Arizona who called herself The Kitchen Chemist.  Her salve had the reputation of being the best in the Southwest.  I wrote the instruction sheet for its use.  It was bloodroot-based.  Unfortunately, no one can reach her now.  She was in her 80s and may have passed away.  To my knowledge, no one ever learned completely her recipe or process.  If anyone has any knowledge of her whereabouts, please contact me at RRR; 9927 W. Peoria Ave.; Sun City, Ariz. 85351.  Note: This works.  Surgery can never be counted on to get all the toxified tissue around the central tumor, virtually assuring a future recurrence.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4495\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4495\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4495\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 6, 2013 at 6:15 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4495#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4495\", \"4495\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Richard . . . in all candor, I have never heard of this &#8220;Kitchen Chemist&#8221; before, but she was obviously using an earlier embodiment of Black Salve, which was based primary on a zinc chloride / bloodroot / humectant combination.

You are likewise a liar like Greg &#8211; or just exceptional stupid.<br />\nProfessor Abel is not a professor &#8211; he is a doctor. He is not a medical doctor &#8211; he is a statistician. He did not publish in the Lancet. He first published a monogram in 1991 in an in house publication of  the Gerson clinic. ( Yet another place , located in Mexico where for a lots of money you too can drink  raw liver smoothies and have coffee enemas &#8211; then die) . He then published the same material &#8211; albeit expanded in the journal &#8221; Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy in 1992. No, Id never hear do fit either.<br />\nIf his work too ten years then most cancer papers look at five year follow up  and take approximately two years to analyse and publish so this means his work was based on studies carried out and ending before 1974. So almost 40 years ago.<br />\nIt was a very thin study, not a meta analysis and asked opinions of some oncologists from which he drew his own conclusions. He did not detail all the studies nor did he offer comparisons or filter any studies to allow comparison. In short it was nothing.<br />\nSo a paper by  one non professor,  non medical person based on studies from forty years ago using non stastical analysis to provide an opinion and published in a journal no one has heard of. Cant get any better proof than that then can you?<br />\nObviously seeing the light he then went on to be involved in three other publish trials of chemotherapy up til 1999 &#8211; the last being on pancreatic cancer.<br />\nThis is life comparing the chance of surviving a road traffic accident now based  on studies of the 1973 Ford Pinto with no air bags, ABS, seat belts, crumple zones, fuel cut off, pre tensioners or collapsible steering column by a non engineer published in a photography magazine and saying it is valid proof today.<br />\nJust utter crap. its the problem with you thieving lying types &#8211; you dont provide proof and get rather aggressive when it is pointed out you are talking complete bullshit. Rather than facts there is the inevitable attack/ conspiracy theory/ brainwashing/ &#8220;disinfo&#8221; agent/ big pharm/ mafia/ Spain castle/ prostitutes/ greed/ paid informant drivel.</p>\n<p>The notion that it might just be some person with a reasonable and rational questioning approach asking valid questions is simply too great to contemplate.<br />\nThe power of the internet allows information to be checked. it also allows people to invent references or testimonials or statements which are false.</p>\n<p>And if chemotherapy doesnt work just as an example  &#8211; Lance Armstrong? Childhood leukaemia &#8211; from virtually incurable to over 90% success? Please provide some evidence rather than just weird accusations. I wait with baited breath &#8211; or will you just give &#8221; the dog ate my homework&#8221; excuses like dear old mr Caton &#8211; the man with two convictions for fraud and couterfiting &#8211; but you believe him.

Are you serious???<br />\nvanguard posted about a paper that effectively doesnt exist. It wasnt published where he said and was of poor quality ( as you wouldnt know what this means just take it from me) by someone who participated  afterwards in studies of chemo whose professional standing he exaggerated dooesnt contain proper statistical analysis , was a single author and published initially 22 year ago based on 40 year old studies. This may be acceptable to you but to me it looks like a crock.<br />\nIn what way is this spam? The post was misleading and disingenuous. You address none of these facts but like all fakes try and shut down any criticism by equating me to a rapist. Thats very mature but it doesnt really address any of the issues. Largely because you are not capable. You just drivel on about irrelevant issues or quote your own web site&#8230;&#8230;..again&#8230;&#8230;..and again&#8230;..</p>\n<p>You on the other hand must be pissed off.

Involve money in medicine and corruption will occur.  Any kind of medicine &#8211; especially fake.The US ranks outside in virtually all health parameters. This is an entirely different issue. You are simply using it as an excuse to peddle your potions and forget that there is a whole world out there where a different health care system payments mean that your conjectures about doctors being paid more is simply and utterly wrong. There is a huge difference from a genuine medical mistake and deliberately selling something which will potentially endanger someone&#8217;s life when you have no proof it works. </p>\n<p>Once again I have stated the falling death rates from cancer , the effect of chemotherapy on leukaemia as an example and again you ignore it , pretend and run away saying if its not on my website its false.</p>\n<p>You are si,mply a pathetic individual who doesnt have a shred of manliness to try and asnswer a few questions.

I never commented on Vanguard&#8217;s cited study specifically because I&#8217;ve never seen it before.  As for quoting my web sources, I have &#8212; throughout my career &#8212; had to address thousands of Medical Industrial Complex apologists, like you, and that is why I created hundreds of web pages to address specific issues.</p>\n<p>You insist that quoting one&#8217;s own work is somehow unprofessional, invalid, or otherwise dubious.  Like so many of your posts, it&#8217;s a non-sequitur.  What is WRONG if I provide posts to expand on something which I&#8217;ve already have to address hundreds of times before &#8212; especially since so much of my work is heavily footnoted with authoritative references?</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>Michael . . .   I stand by my assertion that you&#8217;re an orthodox medical hack and you lack credibility. You don&#8217;t see any of your supporters around here rallying to your selfish cause, now do you?  There&#8217;s a reason for that.  If you did enlist the &#8220;aid&#8221; of supporters, all the normal people would leave and you&#8217;d end up talking to yourselves.</p>\n<p>As for the fact that I actually do make money as an herbalist, and have for most the past 22 years, how dare you compare me to the likes of million dollar a year internists, big pharma execs, and hospital corporation trustees. In your worldview, anyone who doesn&#8217;t belong to your idea of the &#8220;system&#8221; is committing fraud on the public if they earn one cent making a living.  Only an MIC hack would have the nerve to suggest that someone is working in the alternative medical field &#8212; which is very dangerous to begin with &#8212; because they are &#8220;in it for the money.&#8221;  You say this with such frequency because nobody knows more about profiting big with a system that so completely bankrupt &#8212; morally and ethically &#8212; than someone like yourself.  It is a deflection of your guilt &#8212; what the Kabbalah calls &#8220;bread of shame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nobody here is buying your nonsense, Michael . . .  nobody.<br />\nAs you can see in the Veritas Magazine article I posted, properly prepared escharotics, in general, and my products, specifically, work.

Sorry I could not reply earlier but some people have to make an HONEST living, unlike yourself of course who get&#8217;s paid for trying to discredit real medicine as used for thousands of years before the Chemical Boys got involved. Anyway, just to put you straight, Dr Ulrich Abel was indeed medically trained at The Institute of Epidemiology and Biometry at the University of Heidelberg/Mannheim Tumor Clinic. This hospital represents itself as a &#8216;World Class Oncology Hospital&#8217; so you might assume that they know a little about cancer. His reasearch from that hospital on the effectiveness of Chemotherapy was damning as mentioned earlier. Interesting that you cite Lance Armstrong as a good example of a Chemotherapy success story. He is obviously someone that you admire and as probably one of the most successful liars in history, having deceived the world for 20 years or more, he is a prime example of how lies and deception can be very proftiable, but in the end, evil allways gets found out..</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4505\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4505\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4505\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 7, 2013 at 9:36 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Vanguard . . . you will NEVER convince Michael Murray of anything.

I have to believe you&#8217;ve never taken a course in human physiology. Although hyperthermia-type cancer therapies are hardly cures, I think it is entirely unfair to discount the research done in this area. But hey &#8212; you&#8217;re anti-natural, so why shouldn&#8217;t we expect this of you?  A common mammalian response to viral attack is fever.  It is the body&#8217;s way of using hyperthermia to immunologically target the virus.  What is the response of Big Pharma to this very natural, self-induced way of curing the problem?  Medication to lower the fever, or course.</p>\n<p>You seem to hate asparagus.  Did your Mommie make you eat it as a toddler?  I&#8217;m so, so sorry you had to endure that.  Bad Mommie!</p>\n<p>As it turns out asparagus is one of a variety of vegetables that contain cancer-fighting phytochemicals that should be included in any natural approach to curing cancer.  Raw asparagus, broccoli (and other brassicas), tomatoes, apricot seeds, turmeric, and raspberries all contain anti-cancer compounds and unless allergies with one or more are present, should be employed in treating cancer successfully and avoiding the salivating oncologist&#8217;s desire to get you on chemo or radiation therapies.  Max Gerson (M.D.) cured MANY patients using diet alone, and I personally have met about two dozen people who successfully treated their cancers using diet as their primary weapon.</p>\n<p>Henry Beil (M.D.) wrote &#8220;Food is Your Best Medicine&#8221; in 1965.  It had a deep effect on me early in my career.  The title says it all . . .  and it takes medical industrial prostitutes, like Murray, to divert us from the obvious when it comes to the ways and manners we should be treating our own bodies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4544\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4544\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2f3ac6f81a367988befb36d63dff73d5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">sansa</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4544\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 10, 2013 at 5:00 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4544#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4544\", \"4544\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to sansa'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>My best guess Murray = Caton</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4546\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4546\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4546\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 10, 2013 at 12:25 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4546#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4546\", \"4546\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>&#8221; Murray = Caton &#8221;<br />\nYou couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth.<br />\nPhilosophically, we don&#8217;t even reside in the same universe.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4547\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4547\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">thankfully the final word.........it gets tiring dealing with snake oil salesmen</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4547\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 10, 2013 at 1:19 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4547#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4547\", \"4547\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to thankfully the final word.........it gets tiring dealing with snake oil salesmen'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>LOL!! well done Greg &#8211; now three points of fact &#8211; you are doing well</p>\n<p>Lets summarise<br />\nI am a professional published graduate &#8211; Greg is not<br />\nI have not an ex convict with convictions for fraud and forgery &#8211; Greg is<br />\nI am not a conspiracy theorist who believes all  established institutions, journals universities, drug companies, governments , medical institutions and all doctors only have one role which is to increase death rates and only treat one disease &#8211; cancer &#8211; with only one modality &#8211; chemotherapy. Greg does.<br />\nI do not believe in unproven techniques like injecting distilled water, giving vitamins and massaging naked children to get rid of cancers. Greg does,<br />\n I do not beleive putting a chair in a box to heighten sexual satisfaction will get rid of cancer. Greg does.</p>\n<p>I do not believe in a multitude of theoretical explanations for the cause of cancer  Greg does.<br />\nI believe different cancers can be caused by environmental substances including , smoking, radiation, UV exposure, some infective agents,inherited genetic defects, acquired genetic defects, alcohol  Greg does not.<br />\nI believe that cancer is a huge range of diseases and locations and suggesting one treatment modality is patently incorrect . Greg does not.</p>\n<p>I do not believe in theories  and treatments which mostly date from before  the second world war if not longer. Greg does.<br />\nI believe if you are going to show the success rate of a treatment you must show the person has the condition and follow them up to show they survive. In essence the most basic of proof.<br />\nGreg does not.<br />\nI do not believe that anonymous unverifiable conversations statements, photographs or Youtube videos are sufficient evidence of proof. Greg does.<br />\nI believe that if you are going to claim you are treating people you should have seen the patient, examined them, established the diagnosis and follow them up . Greg does not.<br />\nI do not admire mentally ill people who think their father came from outer space, sexually molested children  or experimented on Africans to their death.Greg does.<br />\nI believe that the average life expectancy has increased, the mortality from cancer has decreased from over 90% in 1926 to an average of 36% at five years in 2000. Greg does not.<br />\nI believe that chemotherapy for childhood leukaemia has decreased mortality from virtually 100% in the 1940&#8217;s to less than 10% today . Greg does not.<br />\nI believe that the mortality from myocardial infarction has decreased  from 2000- 2010 from 78/100,000 to 34/100,000.. Greg does not.<br />\nI believe that pathological processes and pharmaceutical action should be understandable and not  be in the realms of being unexplainable or biologically impossible.Greg does not.</p>\n<p>I believe in the last thirty years the following have contributed to better treatment and survival rates all of which were not  widely available before any of the mass of theories that he believes in.<br />\nMRI , CT scanning , ultrasound, computerisation,  interventional radiology, genetic screening, stem cell research, immunosuppression for  transplants, organ replacement, better antibiotics, better screening programmes,  improvement in blood pressure control,  more effective medicines, improved immunisation, bone marrow transplants, public health campaigns, reduction in smoking. Key hole surgical techniques improved audit, research and disease surveillance. Greg does not.</p>\n<p>I believe that if inexpensive treatments are shown to work for disease treatment or prevention they will be adopted rather than not as they will not raise money for the pharmaceutical industry like magnesium for ecalmpsia,  folic acid to prevent birth defects,aspirin to stop cardiovascular disease complications or be investigated at the reduction of bowel cancer. Greg does not.</p>\n<p> I do not believe if a group of professionals were to discover and publish these results in a peer reviewed journal , as they have in these cases,that the information would be out there and there would not be able to be suppressed by external organisations. Greg does.</p>\n<p>I believe that when properly tested if the results show a treatment to be ineffective then it should be abandoned as with many previously &#8220;conventional treatments like laparoscopic hernia repair. The following have been tested and shown to be ineffective . Homeopathy, Gerson technique, Hoxley paste,  Rafe machine, &#8220;vitamin b 17&#8221;. Greg does not.</p>\n<p>I believe that many &#8220;alternative health practicioners will not put their treatment forward for testing as they not not want it to be shown they are ineffective . Greg does not.</p>\n<p>I do believe there are fake treatments for cancer being sold. Greg only does if it is his own which he then blames on a competitor</p>\n<p>I am able to answer direct questions. Greg is not.</p>\n<p>And lastly and most importantly I do not sell potions nor make my living  from a third world out with jurisdiction of proper controls . Greg does.</p>\n<p>I do not believe there is such a thing as &#8220;alternative medicine&#8221; I am with Richard Dawkins<br />\n&#8221; It either works or it doesnt work &#8211; if it works it is medicine. If it doesnt it isnt&#8221;</p>\n<p>I believe that the &#8220;alternative &#8221; health care market is worth around $30 billion in the USA alone and is therefore worth the investment of false claims and multiple websites to obtain a share of that market,.Greg does too.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4548\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4548\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4548\">\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 10, 2013 at 3:53 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4548#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4548\", \"4548\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Murray . . . before it was readily apparent that you were on the board to defame alternative medicine.  This much was clear.  But now I think you&#8217;ve thrown a head gasket.  BETTER THAN 90% OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN YOUR POST ARE MORE THAN SIMPLY LIES &#8212; YOU MADE THEM UP.  Like having stated that you were touch with Veritas Magazine talking about my involvement with them, when I knew this to be impossible.</p>\n<p>And all this talk about using distilled water for cancer (?) &#8212; (an excellent cure for thirst, by the way) &#8212; and naked children and myocardial infarctions and what-not . . .  where do you get all this nonsense?   You can read this entire thread and not find one instance where I have mentioned any of it.  YOUR DESIRE TO FLAME ME PERSONALLY IS SO GREAT THAT IS NOTHING TOO OUTLANDISH THAT YOU WON&#8217;T POST.  It seems to come from a demented mentality that if you lie often enough, eventually something will stick.  It isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Interestingly I have never had a State charge for anything in my entire life.  I have had two &#8220;Federal&#8221; run-ins &#8212; one in 1989 in which an associate in one of my businesses (George Ackerson) ran some $100 bills through a photocopy machine at my printing company (none of them passable) &#8212; an event I detail in Meditopia (Chapter 3) that resulted in a slap on the wrist (as no was intending to actually pass those photocopies). And then my FDA charge in 2003, which I detail exhaustively online to such an extent (because it is my intent to show how scandalous it is on the part of the U.S. government).  Everyone of your posts contains the same mantras, which &#8212; like that self-confessed disinfo agent, Dr. Stephen Barrett &#8212; gets tiring.  &#8220;Fraud,&#8221; &#8220;quack,&#8221;  &#8220;snackoil doctor,&#8221; etc. . . .  No mention is made of the fact that NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, has ever taken me to task for what has been posted on Meditopia since 2004.  Least of all, you.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t.  You can only do what you do now.  Make statements that you attribute to me that I never made.  Ignore my responses.  Give no thought to the fact that the materials I have put online are more thorough than anything you can reasonably present.</p>\n<p>You seem to be proud of your pedigree.  You shouldn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s not a badge of honor.  It&#8217;s a badge of shame.  Your supreme reliance on formal education from a system that has performed so horrifically is not something I would brag about.  As historian, Gary North (Ph.D.) has noted :  &#8220;Always beware &#8216;respectable people,&#8217; so they are beholden to the very institutions that are the source of that respectability.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Your flames do not, of course, reflect the fact that my mentors were THEMSELVES formally educated and realized that in their OWN process of post-formal-education they had learned far more than they could have ever learned in a university.  Dr. Russell Jordan taught me the history and practical art of escharotic preparations.  He was a teacher of virology at the University of Michigan medical school.  He could have chosen any number of people to impart what he knew before he died, but he taught me.  He was not a lightweight, like you, Murray, he was the co-founder &#8212; earlier in life &#8212; of not one but TWO successful pharmaceutical companies (i.e. Vipont Pharmaceutical and Chemex, Inc.)  Only late in life did he realize that modern medicine was a broken system that was beyond repair.  I detail ALL of this in Chapter 1 of Meditopia.</p>\n<p>The idea that orthodox medicine&#8217;s greatest legacy is that it has suppressed legitimate cures clearly annoys you.  I understand that.  It is why your posts are all ostensibly erratic and irrational. But virtually ALL MAINSTREAM MEDIA &#8212; be it in the the field of orthodox medicine, politics, education, technology, etc. &#8212; is beholden to large financial interests.  This is the entire point of the journalists&#8217; anthology, &#8220;Into the Buzzsaw :  Journalists Expose the Myth of a Free Press&#8221; by  Kristina Borjesson.</p>\n<p>Murray, here are the simple facts of the matter :<br />\n( 1 )  You are going to believe what you want to believe because your mind, heart, and soul are tied to orthodox medicine.  No amount of evidence will persuade you otherwise.<br />\n( 2 )  You are on the wrong side of history, and this is evident by the astonishing number of people who are abandoning the orthodox approach and evaluating alternatives.  As Dr. Eddy (M.D.) says in his writings (see Chap. 4 of Meditopia), orthodox medicine has been mortally wounded by AVOIDING an evidence-based approach.  &#8220;Doctors don&#8217;t know what they are doing,&#8221; he says.  Keep in mind this is coming from an esteemed colleague much farther up the totem pole than yourself; he&#8217;s an M.D.; and he has a Ph.D. is mathematics and statistics.<br />\n( 3 )  You can do nothing to address the criminal behavior that is now part and parcel of modern medicine.  The Ecuadorean government here issued a ruling last April that I had been kidnapped without any legal foundation whatsoever &#8212; (www.meditopia.org/chap3-3.htm).  And because your side can&#8217;t win on the evidence, you&#8217;re getting even more ridiculous.  Nirvana Anderson is an Australian woman who created a website ONLY TO DISCUSS how our product cured her cancer &#8212; with documents and pictures. She doesn&#8217;t sell anything.  Never has.  She represents no one but herself.  AND YET the TGA (Australia&#8217;s equivalent to the FDA) raided her and said she had to take her website down.

On the way back from visiting Russian billionaire, Brinsolov, who owns one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Russia, one of his representatives told me,, &#8220;We get our best research ideas from watching who the American government prosecutes.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>Reich may have been eccentric.  I couldn&#8217;t say because I have never claimed to be an expert on Reich and I do not use orgone energy in my own work.  But the trumped up FDA charges against him and the manner in which he was assassinated by U.S. agents in 1958 just before he got out of U.S. federal prison is an indicator that Big Pharma wasn&#8217;t happy with the success of this work.  I&#8217;m not the first to make this observation.  Many other researchers have made note of it.</p>\n<p>( 2 )  William F. Koch &#8212;  Dr. Romero (M.D.) is using Koch&#8217;s technology in Mexico extensively and has a very high success rate in treating cancer.  You know NOTHING about Koch or his work.  If you did, you would know that glyoxylide was a homeopathic, and if you use chemical analysis to test ANY homeopathic that it potentized to 10(6), you will get just water.  The mechanism of action of any highly potentized homeopathic is energetic, not chemical.</p>\n<p>Oh &#8212;-  I forgot.  You don&#8217;t think homeopathics have any value, either . .. . after all, it puts no money in your pocket.</p>\n<p>( 3 )  &#8220;Lunatics you are in love with . . . &#8221;  Quick comment . . . If a fellow medical researcher &#8212; past or present &#8212; is having clear and convincing clinical success, I will investigate it and perhaps even use it in my work. I don&#8217;t care whether you care for them or not.  You can&#8217;t argue with success.</p>\n<p>( 4 )   &#8220;Any would be good.&#8221;  The studies that are the basis of my work are quoted in Meditopia.  You don&#8217;t like the results.  So they are not valid in your eyes. Tough.</p>\n<p>( 5 )  &#8220;Rath carried out trials that killed people.&#8221;  Like Reich, I am not an expert on the work Rath has done SINCE his close working relationship with Dr. Linus Pauling.  What I DO know that their evidence in condemnation of statin drugs was very convincing and compelling.  See Chapter 4, Section 4 of Meditopia (www.meditopia.org).</p>\n<p>( 6 )  On Grading . . .   Predictably, you are like every apologist I ever met who believes that all things that pour forth from the Medical Industrial Complex is good, noble, and holy.  My work is &#8220;F -&#8221; in your eyes because it does not conform to your worldview.  </p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing . . .  tens of thousands of end users around the world know that Cansema cures skin cancer 99+% of the time.  They are eyewitnesses to its performance, and it costs a small fraction of the cost of conventional approaches.</p>\n<p>Is there ANY conventional treatment for skin cancer that gets that kind of success rate?  Of course not.</p>\n<p>Murray . . . you&#8217;re an angry, enraged man because you&#8217;re on the losing end of performance.  This is a battle you cannot win, because this just happens to be one business where actual performance trumps the power of propaganda.</p>\n<p>I shouldn&#8217;t blame you.<br />\nIf I were in your shoes, I might be a raging, irrational, maniacal lunatic, too.

It doesnt seem apparent. Youi dont see patients so you are assuming they have the condition. how long and how do you follow them up to know it has gone and what is the period of time before you declare them disease free? Assuming this is talking about  non melanotic skin cancers?<br />\nWith &#8220;internal cancers again what is your success based on? telephone conversations?<br />\nThis is not some kind of outrageous questioning this is basic common sense.<br />\nAs for conventional treatment  for skin cancers coming close I believe it is around 94-98% &#8211; even you would have to admit that was &#8220;close&#8221;<br />\nHowever if your only &#8220;proof&#8221; is your word in reality that doesnt count for anything and and again I know you struggle with this concept &#8211; it cannot be demonstrated.<br />\nIf you do not know enough about the fakes that you are praising I would suggest reading a bit more about them . Surely you are not suggesting that a chair in a box would treat anything?<br />\nAs for Dr Romero &#8211; surprise surprise &#8211; he has used homeopathy to treat tumours &#8211; and how do you know this? Because someone will have said it on his website thats how. But you are right homeopathy has been shown to be completely ineffective.<br />\nKoch if you didnt know claimed to have synthesised a compound. But wrong again &#8211; it puts money into the pockets of homeopaths</p>\n<p>Your evidence is non existent &#8211; you dont have any . It is not my eyes it is anyone with half a brain. You dont treat patients, You dont have a diagnosis . You dont know what is wrong with them ,, You dont follow them up so how can you possibly know what your success rate it . It is simply impossible.<br />\nYou clearly are deluded enough to state that because you say people have said it works that is sufficient. It is patently not.<br />\nCombined with your denial of death rates from cancer, success in leukaemia, and increasing life expectancy from every source in the world but you believe  anonymous statements  clearly trump that.</p>\n<p>And you dont know anything about Rath &#8211; well you sang his praises in a previous post and I gave you information about him. So you are either ignorant or have a selective memory loss.</p>\n<p>Im not looking to win nor am I angry. I am just trying to protect people who might otherwise die by buying  fake unproven evidence free potions  and who do not have a diagnosis</p>\n<p>And really you need to stop playing the &#8220;assassinated&#8221; card quiter so often&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Paracelcius , Reich&#8230;&#8230;Raffe dies of an overdose &#8211; what at 83?

Another sure sign of a zealot, Pauling couldn\u2019t tolerate data that contradicted his belief in vitamin C.

While none of these studies intended cancer outcomes to be primary endpoints, the meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated nearly 20% decreased risk in overall cancer mortality after a 20-year follow-up period, with most of the benefit occurring after five years of aspirin use (hazard ratio 0.66, p = 0.003). The reduction of cancers was most significant for esophageal and colorectal cancers, but an overall gastrointestinal (GI) cancer reduction was observed for patients with &gt;10 years of follow-up (representing a larger pool of patients). Particular attention was paid to GI cancers as studies have long suggested that aspirin and even other NSAIDs may decrease colorectal cancers.[4-6] Moreover, in this meta-analysis, significant reductions in cancer deaths were also observed for lung cancer and for a variety of other solid cancers; no survival benefit was observed for hematological cancers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4777\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4777\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c7d045151c20539167908495e0bfeda0?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Lore Schanno</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4777\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 1, 2013 at 9:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4777#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4777\", \"4777\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Lore Schanno'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>kin Cancer.

This would include John Pattison, M.D. and Eli G. Jones, M.D.  This is, of course, well before the Medical Industrial Complex began targeting natural cures in favor of far more profitable approaches, including chemo, radiation, and invasive radical surgery . . . before efficacy was thrown out the window . . . before the eugenic high priests of orthodox medicine took over.  I detail this development in Chapters 1, 2, and 4 of Meditopia (see <a href=\"http://www.meditopia.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.meditopia.org</a>). The evidence is both massive and nauseating.</p>\n<p>In the tons of Black Salve &#8212; (yes, tons) &#8212; I have made since 1990, I&#8217;ve never used flour.  It&#8217;s only contribution is that of improving consistency.  There are herbs and processing techniques you can use to improve consistency without adding an ingredient that does nothing to further its medicinal properties.</p>\n<p>Greg Caton<br />\nAlpha Omega Labs</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4960\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4960\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">michael murray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4960\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 27, 2013 at 10:38 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4960#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4960\", \"4960\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to michael murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>So at a little over a million dollars a ton its not surprising you produce this crap about how cancer mortality was lower one hundred years ago&#8230;.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4970\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4970\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6e252ae05d233ce0c031b877ed9bfe8a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4970\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 28, 2013 at 12:37 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4970#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4970\", \"4970\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Greg Caton'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>If you address a post to me and it isn&#8217;t at all cogent or logical, don&#8217;t expect me to respond in kind.

Kills people?  Oh really?<br />\nPray tell, Fred McMurray, just exactly how does that work?</p>\n<p>I get sick and tired of hearing you orthodox people rant with one fraudulent statement and made-up fact after another.  It is now 2013 &#8212; ten years since the FDA destroyed my U.S. lab &#8212; and still, S-T-I-L-L, you have doctors using the Sue Gilliatt case (see Chapter 3 of Meditopia) as their poster girl for WHY black salve is dangerous.  They even made it the lead subject of a book targeting natural remedies.</p>\n<p>You never hear them mention that on Page 93, Line 14 of a sworn deposition she took in July, 2004 (cited, again, in Chapter 3 of Meditopia) that she confessed to removing her own nose with embroidery scissors.  It had nothing to do with the use of Black Salve . . .  So yeah . . .  she was a complete psych job . . .  and she is the one oncologists cite as proof that you shouldn&#8217;t use Black Salve.</p>\n<p>I have already posted (some 10 to 15 posts ago) information that completely destroys any notion that orthodox medicine is &#8220;winning the war on cancer.&#8221;  Certain cancer types may have dropped, just as polio numbers went WAY down, beginning in the 1940&#8217;s, after which orthodox medicine fraudulently began taking credit for this fact with the introduction of vaccines.  Never mind that it is an epidemiological fact that polio had dramatically dropped on its own.  On balance, cancer rates are way up, and as the Starfield Report noted in the June, 2000 issue of JAMA, it is exacerbated by iatrogenesis . . .  doctor screw up.</p>\n<p>As for my earlier statement, yes, a small jar is enough most individual cases of skin cancer.  And, yes, one jar will treat a room full of people who have a single growth to treat. But Black Salve isn&#8217;t just used for skin cancer.  It is, for example, frequently used on breast cancer.  (Go 70% of the way down the most current testimonial page at <a href=\"http://www.altcancer.net/cantest12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.altcancer.net/cantest12.htm</a>). Something this large is GOING to take one or two large jars &#8212; perhaps more. Additionally, you do not take into consideration the fact that there are people who may have a dozen or more growths that they treat.  They still count as just one person.  But they are treating quite a number of growths.</p>\n<p>Arithmetic, Murray . . .  arithmetic.  You really need to bone up there.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4983\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4983\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">answer the questions and stop avoiding them</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4983\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 29, 2013 at 6:27 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I asked &#8221; How do you calcualted your mortality of 50% for internal cancers &#8221;<br />\nYou didnt answer</p>\n<p>I asked how you explain the drop in mortality in childhood cancer from  almost 100% to less than 10% (with this abomination of modern medicine)<br />\nYou refuse to answer</p>\n<p>I asked you to answer without refering to your own website &#8211; fail.</p>\n<p>I asked repeated for the reference to the paper in 1848 treating 3000 people with black salve in London. No paper.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Polio cases reached there peak in the 1940s and 1950s&#8221; &#8211; Immunisation followed afterwards along with the development of ventilators to replace the iron lung. So once again you are completely wrong that  and just making things up . If you want to provide evidence to the contrary please do so.</p>\n<p>Infectious diseases did fall with other factors such as improved nutrition and sanitation. However diptheria cases  in the US in the 1920 was equivalent to around 600,000 with 15-20,000 cases. There have been thirteen cases since 2000. The same with at least a dozen other conditions and smallpox has disappeared  The problem is that vaccination doesn&#8217;t fit with your conspiracy theory that all doctors are trying to make money from people being ill and hence these childish arguments.</p>\n<p>You will remember the disclaimer on your own website saying that this &#8221; advice &#8221; doesn&#8217;t not substitute for professional diagnosis . This is how black salve kills people by ignorant people believing unsubstantiated claims about the efficacy or treating cancers.<br />\nYou group all non skin cancers as &#8220;internal cancers and claim about half are cured but you are unable to make any rational explanation of how you know this.<br />\nPeople like you encourage people by your actions to use unproven medicine and will die as a consequence. </p>\n<p>Cancer rates are increasing in some cancers.That is because of the aeitology of cancer. You cant get a secondary cancer from treatment if you havent had a cancer treated in the first place so one agian this statement is simply stupid. Many risk factors are for mutliple cancers. Secondary primaries are common with smoking.<br />\nAge is a risk factor for cancer . prostate cance ris almost universal in men over ninety. As more men live to that age the cancer incidence will increase.<br />\nAnd before you label this as an apologist this is simply factual explaination. You need to stop making up excuses for pathological processes you dont agree with<br />\nAs for your &#8220;testimonials&#8221; it seems strange you have 20,000 of them and have treated 20,000 people.The fact is you have no idea what people have what they are using it for or what effect it has. You dont ask on the order form you dont follow people up nor do you ask for proof of diagnosis.<br />\nIt is all based entirely on your own statements.<br />\nYou are simply changing your statments to justify that you are a liar and refuse to answer direct questions.</p>\n<p>As continuing our commentary on irony you talk of fraud and then make claims about 50% cure rates you cant prove , papers that dont exist and deny simple facts about immunisation or simply make up testimonials or rely on imaginary statements. </p>\n<p>I will ask now for the ninth time &#8211; answer the questions</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4986\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4986\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e0ed8a3a53fde27b1200b2c8a300e207?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.altcancer.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Greg Caton</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4986\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 29, 2013 at 8:42 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Murray, if you had even taken 60 seconds to examine Meditopia, you&#8217;d know that I provide plenty of references for the fundamental work that was done in the 1800&#8217;s.  You seem perturbed that the standards of clinical studies that were conducted by the early pioneers of escharotic preparations do not meet your standards.</p>\n<p>Anyone who will go through this thread will be irritated to find that I have answered your questions at great length, often numbering them point-by-point, and then you follow up with more demands for material that I already covered. I have no compunction for your refusal to acknowledge my information.</p>\n<p>As for the cases we work with, you demand that I provide clinical figures, when anyone who knows what we do are aware that we provide products and work with end users and their practitioners.  We don&#8217;t treat people.  We are not in their physical presence. The vast majority of our customers purchase our products and then we never hear from them again until they order our products again.  I often get emails from customers where they relate an internal cancer &#8212; liver, lung, colorectal, bone . . . it varies &#8212; five or ten or fifteen years ago.  They are grateful, and the fact that they did not get back to me sooner has no bearing on the legitimacy of their experience. You have this perverted notion that if people from your camp cannot verify &#8220;cancer cures&#8221; using YOUR criteria, then lay people have no right to lay claim to any legitimacy of what they&#8217;ve experienced with their own bodies.  What wholesale bullshit.</p>\n<p>The percentages I cited earlier in this thread concern those customers who decide to work with my wife (Cathryn Caton, N.D.), because they have no other practitioner to work with, despite that the fact that my wife always prefers that people have their own local, qualified practitioner to work with.  She documents her successes and her failures, which are about evenly split.  Nowhere on any of our sites have we ever claimed that we have conducted blind studies, nor was the structure of our relationships with our customers such that this was ever possible.</p>\n<p>What irks me most, however, is that the blind studies that you clamor for have turned into a medium of massive fraud by the pharmaceutical industry.  The NE Journal of Medicine had received so many complaints along these lines that they published an article about it a few years back &#8212; this, despite the fact that they get their advertising and virtually all their support from the very industry they were criticizing.</p>\n<p>You lost any molecules of respect I might have had for you when you began pushing &#8212; on this thread where the focus is Black Salve &#8212; on the virtues of vaccinations.  I have dealt with countless doctors over the years who have come to the conclusion, privately, that vaccinations are one of the biggest scams ever pushed by the pharmaceutical industry. I happen to be a fan of the work of Andrew Wakefield, M.D. &#8212; see : <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Callous-Disregard-Autism-Vaccines-Tragedy/dp/B0085SCM4G\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Callous-Disregard-Autism-Vaccines-Tragedy/dp/B0085SCM4G</a>   . . .  and then I have been an eyewitness to this travesty on a very personal level.  My one and only nephew, Daniel, born healthy and without any infirmities, became autistic in 1994 after receiving a set of childhood vaccinations.</p>\n<p>So . . . just keep that disinfo machine going . . .  because the mountain of lies behind the industry you represent just keeps getting more and more evident.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4987\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4987\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ecb8ef5c0690236273af828404adeb6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">try harder</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4987\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 29, 2013 at 10:48 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>The fact that you are a fan should be no surprise. Your terrible website if full of homage to every fake and quack in the last 150 years albeit nothing for over forty years. The similarities between a fake like him who exploited vunerable people and has contributed to the deaths of people and yourself is quite uncanny.<br />\nYou should read Brian Deers excellent dissection of this organized fraud. Its so simple even you would find it hard not to comprehend. But that you admire a conventional medically trained doctor who was funded by big Pharma to promote vaccinations \u2013 albeit single ones \u2013 and made up a paper published in a peer reviewed journal of the type you now object to while withholding any declaration of interest- seems to contradict everything you have said.<br />\nHe did not tell parents he had been paid around $700,000 to gather evidence for the claim that the MMR caused autism. He implied that the triad of bowel disease, autism and MMR were linked in the twelve children.  However even in his paper only six of the children had all three. When the cases were examined none of the twelve had all three . When the pathological samples were re examined none had signs of inflammation.<br />\nThe average time of onset of symptoms of autism was between three months and thirty nine months \u2013 he rounded it up\u2026. to 38 hours.<br />\nA recent study of MRI in neonates has demonstrated that autism is a congenital condition . The notion that is created by a vaccine is simply utterly wrong.<br />\nSo in short it was an entirely fabricated paper by a dishonest man who made a lot of money dishonestly \u2013 now remind me why you admire him again?!<br />\nVaccinations save lives. You have avoided the fact that you were wrong about polio dropping in the 1940s. Polio, tetanus,  whooping cough, mumps, measles ,rubella , H influenzae  have all been reduced by more than 99% and smallpox eradicated completely. Rotavirus has reduced infections in Mexico by over 80%  in a few years. But trying to present facts and patently visible evidence to a denialist  will be predictably rejected. Safe to say that no one of any intelligence holds vaccination theories in any regard.<br />\nI have to say I did laugh at your endorsement by astronaut and scientist\u2026\u2026.he did seem to go a bit loopy at the same time as endorsing you he was driveling on about strange energy and aliens that coinhabited the earth\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!!</p>\n<p>As for answering my questions you haven\u2019t \u2013 you simply say you have and refer continually.<br />\nI have asked about childhood leukaemia and you have never answered<br />\nI have asked for the reference to the paper from 1848 you said was published and you haven\u2019t given it.</p>\n<p>As for your explanation of your cure rates I don\u2019t think I have ever seen a thinner waffle in my life. And again forgetting your earlier post you had said you had treated over 20,000 people and I reminded you that you are an unqualified salesman with a history of fraud and criminal charges \u2013 or as you like to call yourself a master herbatologist.<br />\nThere is no \u201ccamp \u201c for defining what a cure is. It is generally accepted that not being dead or not having the disease is a good place to start. You made extremely definitive claims about \u201c cure\u201d rates which you are now, thankfully,  admitting to be absolutely baseless. THIS  is \u201cwholesale bullshit\u201d. You are saying half the people  with \u201cinternal cancers\u201d are cured when in actual fact you have no idea who had what and who survived or not. You are simply making stuff up on and expecting people to take your word for it. It is just utter crap. If you want a maths lesson in order to get percentages you have to have two numbers \u2013 you don\u2019t have either.<br />\nYou cannot explain how your crap works, what process it undergoes how it travels in the body and what happens to the tumor. You cant explain how something less corrosive than sea water burns the skin and out pops a tumor. Perhaps you need to read your own disclaimer about \u201c this isn\u2019t a treatment ..and there is no evidence\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d it\u2019s the only honest thing you have ever written<br />\nAs for the ND \u2013 not a doctor \u2013 again completely made up  and we have to take your word which we have seen is pretty flimsy. Based on cure rates ? Could be two patients if even any existed. So more \u201cbullshit\u201d<br />\nAnd spare the autism / vaccine fantasy\u2026\u2026\u2026as demonstrated above it is a congenital condition and the paper was removed from history. Even someone as limited intellect as you can see the made up bits. </p>\n<p> Go and read for yourself.

Orthodox medicine has ridden with these peaks and falls, attempting to take credit for a host of phenomenon that occur naturally within mammalian populations. (That includes us, Murray.) Yet, behind it all, orthodox medicine has been a dismal failure, which is why Ivan Illich, after a lifetime of study, could come to the conclusion (by the late 70&#8217;s no less) that, &#8220;&#8221;The medical establishment has become a major threat to health.&#8221;  Anyone who wants to know what a complete joke conventional medicine is, need only read his monograph, &#8220;Limits to Medicine: Medical Nemesis and the Expropriation of Health.&#8221; See :  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Medicine-Medical-Nemesis-Expropriation/dp/0714529931\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Medicine-Medical-Nemesis-Expropriation/dp/0714529931</a>   . . . or that of Dr. Thomas McKeown, &#8220;The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage or Nemesis?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Murray, you&#8217;re like a crooked accountant who cooks the books and condemns anyone who questions the methods you used to come up with your phony numbers.

But SCIENCE, as Thomas Kuhn made so clear in &#8220;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,&#8221; IS NOT ABOUT THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE.

They are called endemic and there incidence is relatively static. \u00a0Some diseases cause epidemics and some pandemics.\u00a0<br />\nTransmission of disease depends on a host of factors type of organism infectivity easy of transmission the role of a vector, geography climate genetic variance. Hence there is no epidemic of rabies or malaria.\u00a0<br />\nSo with many diseases relatively static in incidence a vaccine or twenty are introduced in a country or two hundred and the incidence goes down or in the case of smallpox is irradicated . In countries with cyclical incidence like rota virus the incidence can be tracked for the last forty years and the peaks stop after the introduction. It&#8217;s utterly evident but you are as I have said before the medical equivalent of a holocaust denier. You are simply made to look stupid and the best you can do is pretend that it&#8217;s all made up . As for me cooking the books I&#8217;m afraid you flatter me as I have no real control over the incidence of infectious diseases and who dies from them worldwide .<br />\nThe WHO recognises the extent of the problem. It states five times as many \u00a0articles on harm \u00a0as benefit but mainly without science or evidence and largely from litigatous cultures.\u00a0<br />\nSo hundreds of countries with tens of diseases so several thousand documented \u00a0reductions or removal of each disease in a country and it&#8217;s all a coincidence?<br />\nWhy not demonstrate an epidemiologist who thinks this rather than the personal opinions of a philosopher from 38 years ago?

It doesn&#8217;t make any of them true.  Black Salve is not &#8220;acid paste.&#8221;  We&#8217;ve covered this before, ad nauseam.  Your posts contain this hidden assumption that if you lie often enough, post it frequently, and don&#8217;t stop, that somehow &#8212; magically &#8212; your dribble will assume an air of possibility.  It doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>\n<p>We have NEVER told anyone that they should not get a reliable diagnosis.  Many people, however, are aware that Black Salve is both therapeutic and diagnostic.  Properly made, Black Salve, does little more than irritate healthy tissue.  The presence of cancer cells are required to initiate a full escharotic reaction.  This is a solid fact you cannot change no matter what you do.</p>\n<p>As for launch support for vaccinations, you will find few people in the alternative medical community who will cater to your prejudices.  You make it sound like people such as Andrew Wakefield, M.D., are complete frauds.  For what good reason?  Why would someone risk their life and reputation by warning the public about the dangers of vaccinations?  Why would they make up fake data?  It&#8217;s nonsense.</p>\n<p>Your promulgation of fake cancer figures is nauseating.  I had a friend of mine in Lake Charles, Louisiana, a retired M.D., who &#8212; strictly as a hobby &#8212; would collect newspapers from the 1800&#8217;s.  He wasn&#8217;t interested in the news.  He meticulously studied the obit sections.  He told me on several occasions that the most striking observation from his study was how few people ever died of cancer in those days. </p>\n<p>This correlates with Samuel Milham, M.D. and his work.  He published a book last year entitled, &#8220;Dirty Electricitity :  Electrification and the Diseases of Civilization.&#8221;  His conclusions mimic Ivan Illich&#8217;s.  The man is 81 years old now and throughout a long, illustrious career, he had to deal with one attempt after another to have his data altered by medical authorities who didn&#8217;t like his conclusions.  EM pollution has caused cancer incidence to skyrocket and has introduced a carcinogenic etiology that few people were ever exposed to even a century ago.</p>\n<p>None of this has any meaning to you, of course.<br />\nBecause truth is your greatest enemy.<br />\nIt is anathema to any conventional medical propagandist.<br />\nWhat you do sickens me to no end.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4997\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4997\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">wakefield - what everyone else knows apart from you.</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4997\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 30, 2013 at 5:34 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Im not sure if you are mentally ill retarded or just trying to keep up the pretence just fr the sake of your fraudulent business.<br />\nMy &#8220;talking points&#8221; ?

You have no medical knowledge and are at best a college educated ignoramus. THESE ARE FACTS YOU MORON. They are not disputed by anyone except you.  </p>\n<p>The fact that a man who worked for a vaccine company and was promoting vaccination is heralded by the anti vaccine movement as a &#8220;blend of Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ&#8221; just shows how fucking thick they / you are . You honeslty couldnt make this stuff up.<br />\nAnd please FFS?????? Why WOULD he fabricated research HE DID FIFTEEN YEARS AGO YOU THICK FUCK.<br />\nAt least if you are going to be someones bitch try and keep up. </p>\n<p>Here is a summary&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;<br />\nAndrew Wakefield is about as discredited as it is possible for a doctor to get. He was found to have ordered invasive investigations on children without either the qualifications or authority to do so. He conducted research on nine children without Ethics Committee approval. He mismanaged funds, and accepted hundreds  of thousands of pounds from lawyers attempting to discredit the MMR vaccine, being found by the GMC to have intentionally misled the Legal Aid Board in the process.  He was not just dishonest, unprofessional and dangerous; his contempt for the rules and regulations that safeguard children in research projects was vile.<br />\nHe held one child down with three adults. Another child has his bowel perforated  while gather samples for his research and had life threatening complications resulting in a payout for negligence of \u00a3500,000.<br />\nHe claimed to have found measles in the samples of bowel and CSF. He found none.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the fabrications<br />\n.This is in the public domain &#8211; please feel free to check</p>\n<p>    The paper in The Lancet was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed \u201cnew syndrome\u201d of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with MMR as an \u201capparent precipitating event.\u201d But in fact:</p>\n<p>        &#8220;Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism;</p>\n<p>        &#8220;Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were \u201cpreviously normal,\u201d five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns;</p>\n<p>        &#8220;Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination;</p>\n<p>        &#8220;In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results\u2014noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations\u2014were changed after a medical school \u201cresearch review\u201d to \u201cnon-specific colitis\u201d;</p>\n<p>        &#8220;The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations\u2014all giving times to onset of problems in months\u2014helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link;</p>\n<p>        &#8220;Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was commissioned and funded for planned litigation.</p>\n<p>Why DID he do it ( note the use of the corrrect word &#8211; not WOULD ) ?<br />\nLike yourself to make money.</p>\n<p>Wakefield\u2014in partnership with the father of one of the boys in the study\u2014had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and &#8220;litigation driven testing&#8221;. The Washington Post reported that Deer said that Wakefield predicted he &#8220;could make more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits&#8221; for the new condition, autistic enterocolitis. He was also promoting the use of single vaccines which he was paid for by the company whcih made them.</p>\n<p>There now this isnt too difficult for you.surely??</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5001\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5001\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">wakefield - what everyone else knows apart from you. 2</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5001\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 30, 2013 at 6:02 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Before the introduction of the measles jab in the UK in 1968, about HALF A MILLION people caught measles each year of whom about 100 died.</p>\n<p>Annual measles deaths fell to SINGLE FIGURES after the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1988 but concerns over the jab&#8217;s safety were raised in the late 1990s when Wakefield produced a since discredited paper suggesting MMR was linked to an increased risk of autism.</p>\n<p>Now immunisation has gone down the disease has reappeared&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;what an amazing coincidence.</p>\n<p>Please explain how you see no connection whatsoever?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5316\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5316\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5316\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 20, 2013 at 11:43 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Murray,<br />\nMMR vaccines contained Thimerosal.

I was kidding. You can&#8217;t even write the language correctly. Mmmm, mercury-silver amalgams&#8230; I hadn&#8217;t mentioned those, but since you have, consider yourself quoted on them: &#8220;&#8230; they manage to put mercury in teeth in massive more quantities and no harm there\u2026\u2026arenic is present in many food stuffs and its posionous\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..heavens above even carbon dioxide is a poisonous gas and they put it in fizzy drinks\u2026\u2026..wonders will never cease.<br />\nZinc oxide\u2026a potent chemical irritant..they put that in that black salve crap\u2026\u2026<br />\nMercury in teeth certainly is in much more massive quantities, but it&#8217;s bound up with silver and releases slowly over time. That&#8217;s not so in the case of the vaccine. But in dispute with your claim that there&#8217;s no harm there, the damage it does is enormous. Nobody can ever state  correctly that it doesn&#8217;t leach out and that it does no harm. Anyone with a modicum of knowledge in the chemistry of metals wouldn&#8217;t dare say what you have said except an inveterate liar. It cannot fail to leach and it cannot fail to have toxic effects. Neurotoxin. Neurotoxin. Neurotoxin. Don&#8217;t waste your keystrokes claiming incorrect timing on autism incidences either, nor put it down to a congenital defect as if the cause must be genetic. Incidence patterns suggest something very different. Gestating infants cop the lion&#8217;s share of mum&#8217;s mercury, but I suppose you don&#8217;t know that, either. It occurs to me that it could easily account for the &#8220;congenital&#8221; incidence. See my next post with quotations from a former Boehringer-Ingelheim scientist.<br />\nArsenic is present in certain processed foods and has apparently been fed to chickens for the table, too. Frankly, that&#8217;s just as reprehensible as mercury in vaccines and teeth; there&#8217;s no excuse for any of it; and it must be stopped.<br />\nCarbon dioxide exudes from our lungs. We produce it as a byproduct of metabolism. So if it&#8217;s so toxic, why haven&#8217;t you dropped dead already? Surely the toxic concentration can&#8217;t be so high if you must trouble to cite fizzy drinks? Ahhhh, perhaps it&#8217;s some other gas you&#8217;re full of. Oh! I know&#8230; Hydrogen sulphide&#8230;. Haaahhh&#8230; Where&#8217;s the bloody clothes peg? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s started to seep in through the router&#8230; Something sure smells bad.<br />\nMmmm, zinc chloride&#8230; You know, the way you talk, this stuff must be more toxic than mercury. I make my own hydrated form from Zn ingots and HCl. I put it in the black salve I make. (Snigger!) I get more reliably known purity at less expense that way. Interesting stuff. It&#8217;s got a whole range of distinct hydration states. Ever seen a ceramic material that rings like a bell, but soaks up water to become an oozy goo? Yeah, note that&#8217;s zinc chloride &#8211; not zinc oxide. Didn&#8217;t have that one right earlier either, did you?<br />\nYou&#8217;re not posting to an unknowledgable ignoramus here, nor someone with a miniscule IQ comparable to yours, Murray.

As for Ratajczak&#8217;s review, he told us he doesn&#8217;t find it remarkable. &#8220;This is a review of theories. Science is based on facts. To draw conclusions on effects of an exposure on people, you need data on people. The data on people do not support that there is a relationship. As such, any speculation about an explanation for a (non-existing) relationship is irrelevant.&#8221; Ratajczak also looks at a factor that hasn&#8217;t been widely discussed: human DNA contained in vaccines. That&#8217;s right, human DNA. Ratajczak reports that about the same time vaccine makers took most thimerosal out of most vaccines (with the exception of flu shots which still widely contain thimerosal), they began making some vaccines using human tissue. Ratajczak says human tissue is currently used in 23 vaccines. She discusses the increase in autism incidences corresponding with the introduction of human DNA to MMR [Mumps, Measles &amp; Rubella] vaccine, and suggests the two could be linked. Ratajczak also says an additional increased spike in autism occurred in 1995 when chicken pox vaccine was grown in human fetal tissue. Why could human DNA potentially cause brain damage? The way Ratajczak explained it to me: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s human DNA and recipients are humans, there&#8217;s homologous recombination tiniker. That DNA is incorporated into the host DNA. Now it&#8217;s changed, altered self and body kills it. Where is this most expressed? The neurons of the brain. Now you have body killing the brain cells and it&#8217;s an ongoing inflammation. It doesn&#8217;t stop, it continues through the life of that individual.&#8221; Dr. Strom said he was unaware that human DNA was contained in vaccines but told us, &#8220;It does not matter&#8230;Even if human DNA were then found in vaccines, it does not mean that they cause autism.&#8221; Ratajczak agrees that nobody has proven DNA causes autism; but argues nobody has shown the opposite, and scientifically, the case is still open. A number of independent scientists have said they&#8217;ve been subjected to orchestrated campaigns to discredit them when their research exposed vaccine safety issues, especially if it veered into the topic of autism. We asked Ratajczak how she came to research the controversial topic. She told us that for years while working in the pharmaceutical industry, she was restricted as to what she was allowed to publish. &#8220;I&#8217;m retired now,&#8221; she told CBS News. &#8220;I can write what I want.&#8221; CBS News reporting on Helen Ratajczak\u2019s article linking human-DNA vaccines with autism. [Here, I note several specific items the CBS article raises. 1. The body\u2019s immune system is being thrown out of balance (by vaccines in increasing number and frequency); 2. The prevailing medical opinion disagrees that vaccines are linked with autism, according to Dr. Brian Strom, who in the same breath ADMITS direct association with brain damage \u2013 so what the hell does he think autism is \u2013 sugar addiction? \u201cBrain damage\u201d is much worse and actually adds dozens of other neurological diseases to the list alongside autism, since one must be mindful already that vaccines are notorious autoimmune disease triggers; 3. Toxic Thimerosal in vaccines and if most has been taken out, that still leaves some, but wait! It\u2019s been replaced with something else to continue fuelling the global disease epidemic \u2013 recombinant human DNA and that is your autoimmune disease trigger, because as Ratajczak correctly points out, it is recombinant in humans and therefore \u201cchanges self\u201d to trigger immune response &#8211; permanently; 4. A number of scientists said they\u2019ve been subjected to orchestrated campaigns to discredit their research into vaccine safety issues and especially if it went near autism, indicating SOMEBODY behind the scenes knows precisely that vaccines and autism ARE linked, but is determined to prevent official acknowledgement by those who represent the \u201cprevailing medical opinion\u201d by merely perpetuating an apparent \u201cabsence of peer-accredited proof\u201d; 5. Ratajczak herself was restricted in what she could publish while in the employ of pharmaceutical corporation Boehringer-Ingelheim, but can now write what she wants; 6. She\u2019s not the first who was on the inside of this stinker of an industry to blow the whistle and she won\u2019t be the last. 7. Something not mentioned in this CBS news article is the advent of the infamous \u201cDanish Studies\u201d of 2002 &amp; 2003 organised by Poul Thorsen. These retrospective metastudies produced conclusions that there is no correlation between the Thimerosal-bearing MMR vaccine and the incidence of autism. The studies are widely criticised as being invalid \u2013 that they were corruptly contrived to protect sales of the vaccine and also protect the progenitors of it from litigation or prosecution. There are very strong indications that the claims correctly implicate Thorsen and colleagues in scientific fraud and Thorsen was actually indicted on charges of fraud, money laundering and \u201ctheft\u201d of up to $2 million from the Centers for Disease Control. CDC was the sponsor and major funding source for the studies \u2013 the charges against Thorsen were limited to the financial arrangements of the studies as they were disbursed through a CDC insider named Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp and had nothing to do with the study conclusions. CDC was able to get off the hook and leave Thorsen as the fall guy, yet still benefited from the work of Thorsen and colleagues. Despite the accusations against Thorsen and colleagues on the veracity and reliability of the studies, CDC and other affiliated organisations still cite the Danish Studies&#8217; conclusions to allay public concern in America about the vaccine. Even Dr. Stephen Barrett cites them in his pro-orthodox literature. So although Thimerosal is now supposedly no longer present in MMR vaccines administered to children, I am not aware of any overt official recognition of the Thimerosal-autism link; nor of any class actions of litigation that would surely arise out of a wider public awareness of the real truth.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5342\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5342\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5342\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 21, 2013 at 1:42 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>This is the most delusional crap I have ever read.

It&#8217;s a recipe. Ingredients are:<br />\n1. DMSO 99.9%<br />\n2. MSM 100%<br />\n3. Olive Oil, extra virgin<br />\n4. Emu Oil<br />\n5. Wintergreen Essential Oil in 1:1 Ethanol:water (White Willow bark can be used instead)<br />\n6. Lemon Peel Essential Oil<br />\n7. Calendula Flower<br />\n8. Arnica Flower<br />\n9. St. John&#8217;s Wort<br />\n10. Menthol crystals 100%<br />\n11. Jalapeno fruit<br />\n12. Ginger<br />\n13. Boswellia as 1:1 Ethanol:water extract or pure resin crystals<br />\n14. Black Peppercorn<br />\n15. Turmeric<br />\n16. Cats Claw<br />\n17. Comfrey<br />\n18. Gotu Kola (Indian Pennywort)<br />\n19. Astragalus<br />\n20.Goldenseal<br />\n21. Aloe Vera<br />\n22. Gibberellic Acid<br />\n23. Magnesium Chloride</p>\n<p>Method:<br />\nMost ingredient quantities are flexible. Use your own &#8220;feel&#8221; for the ingredients and what performance you most want to get out of it.<br />\nDMSO steep to extract essences from herbs etc. and then strain and filter them through unbleached paper &#8211; each separately from its own steeping bottle into its own ready-to-mix bottle. For most herbs, I use about 20 g of dried product in 200 ml DMSO. I then use as much filtrate of each ingredient as I want and document the exact amount of each for any given batch. Magnesium chloride dissolved in minimum necessary distilled water. DMSO won&#8217;t dissolve it, but once it&#8217;s aqueous, DMSO will marry with the solution. Simply weigh and add the crystal ingedients, then measure and add the oils. Gibberellic Acid (GA3 Isomer only) is the special one &#8211; an optional ingredient &#8211; but then, so are several of the others listed, anyway. It is only available in 90% purity and I don&#8217;t like that. I purify it further to 99%+ by settling out the heavy metal impuritities in Acetone, drawing 80% of the solution off the top after three days kept still and cool in a tall, slender bottle and then evaporating the Acetone completely. The remaining 20% solution is retained for comparative analysis, but is never used. Only 0.01 gram of this hormone per litre of formula is used, so measure and add it last. The mix is not homogeneous &#8211; the oils rise. So mix thoroughly before decanting into each and every bottle for near-uniform constituency. Bottles are 50 ml or 100 ml narrow-necked amber glass with polyethylene dripper neck inserts. Polyethylene is DMSO-proof. So is Polypropylene. Other than those, the usual glass, steel, wood or ceramic containers only. Same with any other utensils used with it. </p>\n<p>I think you can easily guess what this stuff will do, but firstly, it&#8217;s topical for unbroken skin only.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s foremost an anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Penetrates the skin in mere seconds, takes full analgesic effect in about 45 seconds and just a few drops can last up to 12 hours. I typically get 10 hours out of mine, but that may take more than a few drops &#8211; maybe six &#8211; or even more if the seat of the pain is deep, such as in a hip joint. It&#8217;s because this ingredient list is considerably extended beyond the original dedicated anti-inflammatory and analgesic formulas, which had only ingredients 1 to 13 or 1 to 15 in them. Doesn&#8217;t work for every ache and pain but does beautifully for most &#8211; arthritis, muscular, back, sciatica, sunburn (but not on broken blisters), sprained and broken ankles, migraine and so on. Not for sensitive skin areas such as eardrum, anal region, eyelids, mucous membranes, open wounds etc. It may not actually burn or harm in these regions, but it&#8217;ll sure as hell light up the nerves something fierce for 10 to 20 minutes until acetylcholine neurotransmitters are depleted enough to numb the region. On normal skin areas, it merely feels &#8220;warm and silky&#8221;. Some small percentage of people can show a local allergic reaction on the skin. Test with a drop first before using fully. Cannot be used.internally, must not be swallowed and keep it away from children. Keep it at coolish room temperature and out of sunlight. Never allow it to become contaminated (you know the rules with DMSO). Apply and gently rub it in with fingers &#8211; gloves are not to be trusted.<br />\nSecondly, it&#8217;s a healing promoter, especially for bone, cartilage, tendon and ligament, but it will help just about any tissue to heal faster and may help regenerate arthritic joints over time with regular use.<br />\nThirdly, it&#8217;s a potent antifungal and works brilliantly on tinea, ringworm, etc. Kills the itching for ten hours or longer, but 2 to 3 days of regular use about every 6 hours will also totally eliminate the fungus. I know. I&#8217;ve tested it.<br />\nFourth, it&#8217;s antibacterial and will even handle multi-drug-resistant bugs.<br />\nFifth, it&#8217;s a local immune response regulator, therefore very good for RA, SLE at the local level.<br />\nSixth, it has anticarcinomic and some protective properties, though it&#8217;s not actually formulated with this in mind.<br />\nOther than the cautions mentioned, it is free of any nasty side effects and very potent. I love mine.<br />\nI think you will, too.<br />\nCheers!<br />\nFOOTNOTE: To other readers here, please understand that you need to know what you&#8217;re doing in the making of this stuff, as you would with black salve. It&#8217;s not child&#8217;s play, so although I would not discourage you out of hand, it definitely requires fairly advanced chemistry and herbal knowledge and considerable care &#8211; lest thou inadvertently createth a monster that can harm thee.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5006\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5006\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/143055f9c02c19a5108fb3aca12fdf31?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">noname</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5006\">\n\t\t\t\tMay 1, 2013 at 2:17 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5006#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5006\", \"5006\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to noname'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>You have just made me laugh.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-4994\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-4994\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/26708ecd2e046fdcffef5c58d2eb81a2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">One More Try</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-4994\">\n\t\t\t\tApril 30, 2013 at 12:16 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=4994#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4994\", \"4994\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to One More Try'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Hi,<br />\nI found your website when I was at the end of my ropes.

IIn order for it to penetrate the skin it must damage the cells .If in your supposed treatment of breast cancer it doenst part the cells like Moses and walk through. You are simply making stuff up . You cant explain how it works or how it penetrates skin. You cant explain how the paste works or how &#8220;internal &#8220;tumours are removed.<br />\n There are many published examples  of people being burned or in one case a man creating a perforation of his bowel which I have detailed earlier. But as they are printed in the real world you simply dismiss anything written by anyone more intelligent and more honest than you &#8211; which is virtually everyone &#8211; as fake/ cover up / abomination/conspiracy/ dont need facts or proof / all science is made up. Such a colossal collection of excuses as to why you are right and everyone else is dishonest and wrong.<br />\nYou have repeated said it is cheaper than going to a dermatology clinic &#8211; that you have treated 20000 people that you have a cure rate of more than 99% then admitted you have no records no proof and no idea.<br />\nThen on your webpage make lots of excuses as to why if it doesnt work then it is all down to the user.<br />\nAns sweet Jesus &#8211; an imaginary docotr looking at  old newpapers and this somehow is evidence.

Claims referred to on YouTube claim it curing widespread bone cancers to brain cancer. At the same time decrying every single doctor university researcher government and pharmaceutical company as all being part of a works wide conspiracy to let people die of cancer &#8211; presumably only using the US model of health care as the rest of the world is counted out . Every fake and disproven cancer cure has been used to justify outlandish claims from orgasmatron boxes to vitamins.<br />\nWhat is the  joke is that the alternative health card select is worth billions &#8211; about $40 billion in the US alone- yet the sellers of fake medicine decry profits made by &#8220;big pharma&#8221; as it suits them . I would have thought $40 billion was big in anyone&#8217;s estimations .<br />\nYet ask for evidence and two things always happen &#8211; personal attacks and claims that proof doesn&#8217;t matter. Science is rubbish unless they agree with you &#8211; Nobel prize winners and loopy astronauts . And extending it to simply denying basic facts . Crooks that fabricated results for money have respect and vaccines which eliminated diseases and prevented millions of deaths are simply cashing in on a strange coincidence .<br />\nIf you have a disease make sure you have a diagnosis before embarking on treatment . And make sure the treatment works.

If if doesn&#8217;t it might locally invade , rarely spread or cause much harder to treat complications . I don&#8217;t mind &#8221; having a go &#8221; with cup cake recipes but cancer is a slightly different issue<br />\nSo in my country I could see a specialist for free be diagnosed have a basal cell cancer excised it could be looked under the microscope to ensure complete excision treated in a sterile enviroment using proven techniques and followed up .<br />\nAlternatively I could buy a paste from the Internet which would be home made , not quality controlled and potentially be fake . I would have no idea of its effectiveness or shelf life . I would have no recourse to compensation of it went wrong . It wold then take a period if time of self administered treatment which is dependant on my effort to treat myself.<br />\nI would be relying on the word and evidence of non medical people who by all accounts guarantee cure rates based on speculation and unverifiable sources, are unable to explain how it works , attribute nothing short of magic and physiologically impossible effects and make ridiculous statements like removing  g cancerous lesions by surgery causes them to spread .<br />\nThanks but no thanks .</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5063\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5063\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c4f4dba562d95d49980f4d72db8b984c?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://freeyourmindonline.net/Blog/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Free Your Mind</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5063\">\n\t\t\t\tMay 5, 2013 at 3:57 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5063#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5063\", \"5063\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Free Your Mind'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Wow.

For those who want to use the salve, they should have the right to do so.  If you prefer the traditional medical solution, that is your choice and you should be free to follow that path.  All treatments have successes and failures.  I have had close friends who followed exactly what their doctors had advised but unfortunately passed away.  One required a bone marrow transplant due the effects of chemo and lost her life less than a year after the transplant.  I guess that there there may also be patients who have followed the natural path who have also lost their lives. Whether someone chooses traditional or natural, the patient should feel supported and have faith in their decision.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5073\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5073\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/michael.murray.357622' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Michael Murray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5073\">\n\t\t\t\tMay 6, 2013 at 9:16 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5073#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5073\", \"5073\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Michael Murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Of course people have freedom of choice. However the also need freedom of information . There is a common marketing ploy used by &#8220;alternative&#8221; sellers that natural is good. Many of these sites quote the same historical quacks who to summarise have claimed that distiller water , coffee enemas, small electrical currents, boxes to sit in , vitamin c , different diets and tailored chemotherapy. Most are at least 40 years old and many approaching 100 ..<br />\nquite simply cancer isnt one disease and there will not be one cure. It is big business which prays on the vulnerable and the desperate who will try anything.<br />\n Of course there are unsavoury business practices , fail rates &#8211; however they usually get exposed pretty quickly. Wakefield , researcher on chronic fatigue , anti sickness drug, xigris for septic shock. If there is fraud or it&#8217;s made up it will get found out. However these are the exception and people denying better survival rates and more prevention and screening are simply flat earthers .<br />\nHowever in the &#8220;alternative&#8221; field it&#8217;s multi billion dollar business and they have no morals and know that they have no proof fr what they do amd in many cases know that what they sell is completely ineffective. They are not bound by statute simply profit and it is utterly naive to think these people dont exist. However they make outlandish claims to make money. Mexico or indeed Guatemala seem to be thick with clinics outwith control.<br />\nIf people want to use them that is their choice. Unfortunately many victims of fraud are willing ,.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5074\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5074\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/michael.murray.357622' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Michael Murray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5074\">\n\t\t\t\tMay 6, 2013 at 9:22 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5074#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5074\", \"5074\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Michael Murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>And while success and failures are present in both treatment that is proven and &#8220;alternative &#8221; treatment the existence if both does not equate with equal successes.<br />\nEarly breast cancer has a five year survival of almost 97% -while claiming alternative treatments may have successes it simply isn&#8217;t documented.

But unfortunately, those dishonest people make the honest ones look bad.  I am sure that there are genuine providers of natural products, who care about the health of their customers.  So many herbs in the world have not yet been proven to fix an ailment but just because they are not yet proven, it does not mean that they do not work.  For example, echinacea.  There must have been a time when  echinacea was considered snake oil but now many people use to shorten the severity of a cold with great success. I know that a cold is not a serious illness but this is just a small example of a natural product that does work.  Maybe the perfect solution is for doctors to work alongside naturopaths where they can combine their talents.

I meant that it may not have been proven to work by western medicine.  For example, natural therapists may have used protocol A to fix illness Z for many years, with success.  They can see that protocol A works against illness Z and therefore will continue to use it.  So, it have been proven to work via natural avenues but not proven by western medicine.  Given that western medicine will not use protocol A to fix illness Z, they will probably never see or prove that it works.  I hope that this makes some sort of sense.<br />\nI really do believe that there are some wonderful doctors out there but there are also some very good natural therapists that are helping patients where doctors may not have been able to fix the problem. That statement may also works the other way around where doctors may have come to the rescue where a natural therapist has not been able to assist.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5089\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5089\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5089\">\n\t\t\t\tMay 7, 2013 at 1:46 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5089#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5089\", \"5089\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Im not sure there could be considered to be a lesser degree of burden of proof by the notional attribute to an ancient imaginary Eastern culture.

It will be an 8th period member of a third series of 15 Group T(a) transition elements like Lanthanides or Actinides. It will be radioactive with no stable isotopes and quite possibly have a toxicity similar to Plutonium. About two years ago, I named it Hawkingium (Hk) and the series Teslanides. Not that any of this would mean anything to you.<br />\nAnd no, radiotherapy is destructive, not regenerative. If anything can regenerate the liver tissue, it will be oxidative therapy in concert with conjugated SOD, Glutathione and CoQ10 in two of its three redox states, plus something like Comfrey. But for the cancer, that &#8220;recently discovered rock&#8221; is none of the foregoing, but instead a hydrated Aluminium Silicate of Sodium, Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium, plus our old friend DMSO to deal with the HCV, perform as an adjuvant oxidative agent and do some chelating, potentiating, and differentiating. But all this is just rock basic stuff. It gets quite a bit more involved than that. Now, what have you got? Sticks and stones?<br />\nAnd you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;m doing a Greg. He&#8217;s got nothing to prove to the likes of you and neither have I. You haven&#8217;t even managed to dredge up two rather well-known clinical studies, as it is. As far as you&#8217;re concerned, they don&#8217;t exist. WRONG&#8230;.<br />\nI&#8217;ll tell you what. You still haven&#8217;t troubled to describe how you would treat our hypothetical liver cancer patient, but I think you&#8217;re not going to. Perhaps you want us all to accept that drivel about coffee enemas, chemo, Cansema and &#8211; what else? &#8211; as if you were serious; but even then, you illuminated nothing whatsoever about the administration protocols of anything in it &#8211; no surprises there. You simply don&#8217;t know haw to administer anything of the kind. So I definitely don&#8217;t think you will illuminate anything. After all, the only stuff you&#8217;ve got to fall back on for use in such a case is the poison, slash and burn approach, which will quite comfortably yield a sub-1% survival probability in cases like this one. That&#8217;s a FAIL in any language, even though it is par for the course in allopathic medicine.<br />\nNow, as a consequence of all this verbal time wasting and somewhat unappealing lambasting that&#8217;s been flying about, I have decided YOU don&#8217;t exist. There is no satisfactory proof that you exist. You&#8217;re no better or more substantial, to say nothing of being even in the slightest degree more intelligent or constructive, than one of those fake site agent &#8220;stringer&#8221; profiles on an American-styled adult dating site. They&#8217;re just about as vacuous as anybody can get. But at least they show some manners&#8230;<br />\nThat&#8217;s it. You are erased.

And somewhere amongst all of this, money and profits in the billions are involved. So it&#8217;s inevitable that organised crime involving graft and corruption on a monumental scale, up to and including multiple instances of murder, become involved, too. Unfortunate &#8211; and almost equally unavoidable in the current socio-politico-economic environment. I can only suggest you garner what you perceive to be worthwhile information from the posts and disregard the vitriol.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5410\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5410\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5410\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 29, 2013 at 11:26 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5410#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5410\", \"5410\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>And on the subject of murder (which will swing back to Black Salve as the central point of relevance in this forum) it happens that one Harry Hoxsey is strongly suspected to have been one of those victims at the end of a 35-year battle against Morris Fishbein, the AMA and FDA. Fishbein accused him of being nothing more than a horse doctor and although horse doctors ran in the Hoxsey family, he was nevertheless something more. He distinguished himself in the annals of alternative medicine, not only for being arrested some 157 times in 16 months, but for three cancer formulations passed down in his family and learned from observing what a cancer-afflicted horse ate &#8211; and subsequently recovered fully from the malignancy. Two of these formulas were orally ingested &#8220;tonics&#8221; and one was a topical salve. One might fairly safely presume one of these is ancestral to modern-day Black Salves and if I were to hazard a guess, I&#8217;d even surmise that Greg Caton&#8217;s &#8220;Cansema III&#8221; could be based upon a Hoxsey oral tonic formula as much as Black Salve certainly appears to be loosely based on the Hoxsey topical formula. That is something I consider to be worth investigating and possibly even using, so perhaps you might follow up with Greg Caton himself on Cansema III.</p>\n<p>The Hoxsey formulas have been claimed to yield an 80% success rate in cancer cure, separately so by Hoxsey himself and subsequently by a nurse in his employ who eventually took over the operation and after three years in the US, took it to Tijuana, Mexico. Qualified data on these 80% efficacy claims are not currently available to me and seem rather sketchy. Only one qualification is reported by my info source and that is that it&#8217;s 80% efficacious provided there has been no prior chemo or other allopathic medical intervention. That much makes perfect sense, since in no way should one fully expect a good rate of cure under treatment regimes that crush the Immune System.</p>\n<p>Now, the ingredients are are follows, according to the information source I discovered.</p>\n<p>Harry Hoxsey\u2019s formulas included Red Clover, Burdock root, Barberry bark, Licorice root, Buckthorn bark, Prickly Ash, Poke berries and root, Stillingia root, Cascara Amarga, Potassium Iodide, Zinc Chloride and Antimony Trisulfide.</p>\n<p>Note the similarity with Black Salve. These ingredients are variously anticarcinomic either directly or indirectly, detoxifying, immunomodulating, cathartic, diaphoretic, lymphostimulant, endo-exocrine stimulant, exiguent, anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antibacterial. The Zinc Chloride would be limited to the topical formula, whilst Antimony Trisulphide is an interesting one. If it is included in an oral tonic, it must be in homeopathic concentrations, meaning very, very small. If so, the philosophy behind its use would be along the lines of giving the human system a bit of a nudge and then letting the flow-on effects of a biological response take over. Presently, I have not verified whether it is used as such, or limited to inclusion in the topical formula only. The topical formula, by the way, is obviously an escharotic, like Black Salve as we currently know it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5399\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5399\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4cecb2dd9aaadaac6ac7cfca24e3617c?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.eacd2012.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Olga</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5399\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 28, 2013 at 8:37 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5399#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5399\", \"5399\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Olga'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>wonderful post, very informative.

If it&#8217;s myself, well, thanks! Sorry that I shall probably move on soon, since what I had to offer on the matter of Black Salve has already been posted and I do need to get back to doing other things.<br />\nI do perceive that there are a couple of loose ends to tie up.<br />\nFor example, there may be some confusion among readers regarding Zeolite, due to some disinformation mixed with fact being posted about it in this forum.<br />\nSo to clear that one up, it happens that the epidemic of asbestosis and mesothelioma caused by Zeolite mining in Turkey is quite true. But here&#8217;s where the disinformation was snuck in under the radar. At least 175 different varieties of Zeolite mineral have been documented. Zeolites are formed when volcanic lava meets saline water, resulting in a generalised composition described as a hydrated aluminium silicate of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Because lava composition varies considerably and also because salinity, temperature and pressure of the water involved also varies, the exact chemical constituency, structural morphology, porosity and chemical behaviour of different Zeolites also vary a great deal. They may be used as filtration agents, chemical catalysts in the laboratory, or possibly in the case of Erionite, as thermal refractory material like asbestos,  The type responsible for the epidemic in Turkey is Erionite, a filamentous crystalline type. Its fine needle-like crystals resemble those of Asbestos and indeed, this particular mineral is very much as virulent as Blue Asbestos in destroying lung tissue and causing cancer. It&#8217;s very nasty stuff.<br />\nIn addition, I would not even recommend that anyone inhale any kind of mineral dust whatsoever, whether it&#8217;s any kind of Zeolite or other material. Even without the asbestosis or mesothelioma as it is caused by Erionite, dust encountered in mining operations of any kind is bound to be harmful to the lungs and tends to shorten life expectancy. That would even apply in some degree to Micronised Clinoptilolite, if one were silly enough to inhale it, even though the micronised material will clear from the lungs more easily than non-micronised mineral.<br />\nOK, so Micronised Clinoptilolite is a very different member of the Zeolite mineral group and this is the one specified as the potent cancer cure. It is porous and the pores with a certain electric charge distribution pattern are what capture toxins. It does not have a filamentous structure, does not cause asbestosis and it does not cause any kind of cancer whatsoever. Instead, it is in effect a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor (CDKI) and that means it will cause genetically faulty cells to fail the G-phase fidelity tests in the cell replication cycle and leave healthy cells completely unaffected. It has unparalleled selectivity. Thus it is an excellent anticarcinomic agent. Naturally enough, it is taken orally &#8211; NOT INHALED.<br />\nAnother loose end is Oxidative Therapy, where the most commonly used agents are Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide.<br />\nIs Ozone a poisonous gas? In certain concentration ranges, yes. It can cause oxidative damage to tissues. However, that concentration range varies a great deal between different individuals. Disinformation was slipped in under the radar once again in the form of lack of information on HOW it is correctly administered &#8211; it was simply and blithely described as a poisonous gas. Guess what? Dioxygen, the oxygen we breathe and can&#8217;t survive more than five minutes without &#8211; is also lethally toxic at high enough concentrations and pressures. Ask any deep sea diver. It merely happens that Trioxygen (Ozone) is more so because it is a less stable molecule and therefore much more reactive, as well as having a tendency to release Oxygen singlet radicals. With any oxidative therapy, a strict protocol must be followed in order to mitigate this in favour of managing the radicals for the better, instead of allowing them to roam free to do harm in the system. The most strongly favoured protocols are known as Autohaemotherapies. In these, between 200 ml and 600 ml of the patient&#8217;s blood is removed and treated with the oxidative agent, whether that be Ozone or Hydrogen Peroxide, EX-VIVO. Once it is fully reacted, it is returned into the patient. This signals oxidative stress to the patient&#8217;s homeostatic machinery without actually causing oxidative stress, which then responds by generating increased quantities of endogenous antioxidants &#8211; CoQ10, SOD and Glutathione in particular. This may be repeated about once every three days. The therapy is also called Oxidative Preconditioning. The antioxidants manage the oxygen radicals, direct them where they can do good work instead of harm (Mitochondrial Complex I for example) and protect the tissues. People thus preconditioned can safely absorb much higher levels of oxidative agents than non-preconditioned people and do so without harm, but instead enjoy accelerated healing capacity, better health, a more active, yet balanced immune system and more energy.<br />\nSo it&#8217;s a similar story with Hydrogen Peroxide. It&#8217;s a bleach. Toxic? Yes, again in certain concentrations or dosages. But as with Ozone, Oxygen or even water, there is a range of concentration that is safe and a range that is not. Yep, that&#8217;s even true with water! Ozone is oxidised Oxygen. Likewise, Hydrogen Peroxide is oxidised Water. Both are less than completely stable and release Oxygen singlets. With these singlets, you can make good, or you can make problems. Antioxidants are the keys to effective regulation and tissue protection. You can either stimulate their creation within, or you can infuse them intravenously, or you can take &#8220;protected&#8221; ones orally. Hydrogen Peroxide can be taken orally with greater safety, because you can govern the dosage, whereas breathing ozonated air does not afford the same level of dosage control. In the case of H2O2, use 35% food grade and dilute it with distilled water one part to 34, which is 1%. The protocol for oral ingestion of an oxidative agent, whether it is Hydrogen Peroxide, DMSO or Chlorine Dioxide, is to begin with very small dosage amounts at low concentrations on an hourly basis and slowly increase the doses over a period of 14 to 21 days towards full therapeutic levels, Older people should use a longer preconditioning period. This gives the body time and opportunity to respond to the oxidative presence by creating those antioxidants and progressively increase them towards high enough levels to deal safely with therapeutic dosages of oxidative agent. It&#8217;s a very good way to keep the arteries clear and the heart strong. If you administer full therapeutic doses of an oxidative therapy agent without following such a preconditioning protocol, you will certainly cause harm. Medical supervision is very strongly recommended. Since MD medicos and allopathic clinics rarely if ever provide for such therapies, the logical choices are integrative medicine clinics and ND, BHS or MHS practitioners.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5425\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5425\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5425\">\n\t\t\t\tJune 30, 2013 at 9:41 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5425#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5425\", \"5425\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Summarizing the substantial and growing body of study results showing deleterious health effects of breathing ozone, in 1976, and reiterated in 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reflects the scientific consensus that ozone is a toxic gas which has, as yet, no demonstrated safe medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy.

Respirable erionite fibers were detected in air samples collected from the affected villages, and lung tissue samples collected from mesothelioma cases contained erionite fibers. A higher proportion of ferruginous bodies with a zeolite core were found in inhabitants of the contaminated villages than of those from the two control villages.[4][5][7] Erionite is reportedly present in the local volcanic tuff.[8]</p>\n<p>There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity of erionite in experimental animals.

However, the NCI found that of these 77 reports, only 6 included actual tissue biopsies. Of the 2 biopsies from patients described by Hoxsey as having &#8220;internal cancer&#8221;, neither showed any evidence of actual malignancy. The NCI concluded that Hoxsey&#8217;s records did not contain sufficient information to evaluate his treatment. Hoxsey argued that it was the NCI&#8217;s responsibility to seek out the information necessary to verify his case reports, and attributed the failure to do so to a conspiracy on the part of the NCI and AMA.[12]</p>\n<p>Based on a folk story from the 1800&#8217;s on his grandfathers claim.

The images are quite graphic and do indicate the use of an escharotic of some kind. It&#8217;s unfortunate that there are no accompanying data on the formula, administration methodology and so on. Something else is curious &#8211; the final picture depicts the lady and her nose before treatment began. It looks reasonably healthy to me, so if that&#8217;s so, then why would salve have been applied to it in the first place? Too many unknowns to draw reliable conclusions. That&#8217;s a pity, because if genuine, the whole thing could have been importantly informative. Could there be a contraindication for the use of black salve on tissues with cartilage underlying them? Could that have implications for ears or the costal cartilages? If so, could it be attributable to specific ingredients that possibly should be dispensed with when treating cartilaginous tissue complexes?<br />\nThere&#8217;s another series of questions relevant to this poor woman&#8217;s plight.<br />\nWhat alternatives could be expected to have done better?<br />\nChemo? Not a chance. It&#8217;s systemic and creates a whole range of other serious susceptibilities via immunosuppression and toxicity.<br />\nRadiotherapy &#8211; perhaps Cyberknife? Utterly unthinkable. Not only is there a horribly high failure rate, but the consequences (especially cyberknife) are even worse than what those pictures show. You wouldn&#8217;t use it on your worst enemy.<br />\nMaybe an MAB carrier-based photodynamic therapy could work OK, although MABs are notorious for causing autoimmune diseases and anaphylaxia, which is sometimes fatal. Bit extreme for a nose job.<br />\nSurgery? Ah, this must be the obvious orthodox solution. But OK, that means cutting away the offending tissue, doesn&#8217;t it? I suspect it would yield results quite comparable to what we already see, so the lady would still need to undergo tissue grafting to reconstruct her nose.<br />\nAs I see it, that pretty much leaves other CAM modalities as the only viable options that might produce a more satisfactory outcome. There are a few.<br />\nInterestingly, Clinoptilolite is one of these options, because it has shown efficacy as a topical paste application on superficial cancers. In addition to working in a similar way to something like Bentonite or Pascalite clay, which takes up toxins out of the skin (yes, this kind of clay is a black salve ingredient), but also exhibits a range of direct and superlatively selective anticarcinomic actions, while being at the same time utterly harmless. Even so, whatever is used may not provide a 100% guarantee of complete success. Cliniptilolite&#8217;s efficacy is generally around 90% or so for non-terminal cases of just about any cancer (including liver), or around 75 to 78% for terminal cases, but even it does not yield a universal 100% cure rate.<br />\nThus I still strongly advocate a multimodal approach to the treatment of any patient with cancer &#8211; under a sound Integrative Medicine model. Look to the simplest basic priorities first &#8211; nutrition, lifestyle, positive outlook, immune support, detox, cut out the carbs, systemic pH, tissue oxygenation, eliminate pathogens. Get the basics right and go from there to the more complex stuff.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5444\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5444\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5444\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 1, 2013 at 4:34 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5444#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5444\", \"5444\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>How do you treat a skin lesion ?

The malignancy may very likely have resided in the cartilage &#8211; not the dermal tissue and hence not be visually evident in the last photo. I consider an escharotic would be inappropriate in such a case, because cartilage is very slow to regenerate. On the plus side, it should also be a relatively non-aggressive cancer. I think what would be called for would be a slow apoptogenic treatment supplemented with fibroblastic regeneration promoters, such as Comfrey and Gibberellic Acid. This approach could reconstruct the tissue while the malignancy is being progressively eradicated, thereby causing minimal damage.<br />\nSURGEON: &#8220;Well, dear lady, the operation was a success. Never mind the bloody great hole. We&#8217;ll reconstruct it for you. How good is your medical insurance?&#8221;<br />\nWhen looking at the basics as described, namely nutrition, lifestyle, positive outlook, immune support, detox, cut out the carbs, systemic pH, tissue oxygenation, eliminate pathogens &#8211; these are essentially nonmedical basics. They REQUIRE NO DIAGNOSIS. They are preventive measures to live by in the first instance for good overall health (yes, even pathogens with the right herbal/nutritional components) and in the second instance, still powerfully capable of renormalising compromised biological systems of cancer victims to such an extent that they will cure a significant proportion of sufferers without resort to the more intricate stuff, or necessity to resort to medical interventions. Diagnostics are required, but NOT for any determination of whether these aforementioned measures should or should not be put into effect. They SHOULD BE. This is entirely consistent with the fundamental principle that when you give your body the right resources and opportunity, it will better resist disease and better heal itself. In no disease is it more true than in cancer. LET NOBODY REFUTE THIS. IT IS A FACT. PERIOD. So instead, the diagnostics (which in cases of cancer or any serious diseases are certainly necessary) will be used to determine what other more advanced measures in the form of medical interventions need to be effected IN ADDITION to the basics; and for ongoing monitoring of the patient&#8217;s condition.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5467\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5467\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/michael.murray.357622' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Michael Murray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5467\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 2, 2013 at 5:42 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5467#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5467\", \"5467\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Michael Murray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>More misinformed rubbish.<br />\nBenign cartilage tumours are usually left alone.

The likely cause is overuse and Greg Caton has warned against doing this in no uncertain terms on his Alpha-Omega Labs website. I reproduce part of the narrative from a tube clip with a still picture series found at <a href=\"http://panacea-bocaf.org/alternativecancertreatments.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://panacea-bocaf.org/alternativecancertreatments.htm</a> on black salve treatment as it was contributed by Nirvana Anderson. It highlights what I&#8217;m getting at. Pictures are not included here &#8211; please refer to the clip.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everywhere I put the Salve, I get a reaction. No two sites are identical &amp; they heal quickly, leaving my skin improved. After just a few days, the original treatment has dried and is ready to fall off. There are internet sites that warn about this Salve. Here are the pictures that are used over and over again. I believe the warning pictures are accurate. Never apply the Salve to the whole nose. It requires special care. It is usually the area most extensively damaged by sun exposure. I treat my nose in small sections&#8230; &#8230;because the Salve can&#8217;t discriminate. If there is cancer, the Salve will remove it all. Treating small sections allows each area to thoroughly heal. I  have discovered that many people are fiercely anti-Salve without having seen or tried it. They believe that at best, the cream is a superseded treatment, at worst it is a skin eating caustic product that only fools would use. The following pictures are the results of two treatments. One treatment is Aldara, the other is Black Salve. One has damaged the immune systems of its users, the other hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5486\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5486\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5486\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 3, 2013 at 1:49 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5486#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5486\", \"5486\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>So lets get this straight &#8211; you &#8211; a clearly unqualified person who has repeated demonstrated that you dont know what you are talknig about &#8211; comment on Gregs website regarding a treatment that even you admitted doesnt cure cancer &#8211; that Greg an unqualified ex convict says not  to over do it &#8211; amongst the disclaimers saying nothing he says is medical advice  &#8211; and then report on another nut case unqualfied rant quoting an unqualified ex actress as proof??

Oh, my, that must have been DIFFICULT.<br />\nThanks to Wonderer and Thanks. As already mentioned, I may not stick around too much longer, but as long as I do, I&#8217;ll try to offer worthwhile stuff.<br />\nLet&#8217;s Out Our Trust, you are so right!<br />\nI mean, Western Medicine demands scientific proof. That&#8217;s what the Double Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial is all about, right?<br />\nIt makes the evidence acceptable, replicable, reliable, trustworthy and so on.<br />\nFor example:<br />\nA pharmaceutical corporation gets hold of an idea, which might have come out of university research on a plant, or anywhere else, for that matter. In the case of the plant and usually a single active natural principle isolated from it, it then seeks to develop an artificial method of synthesis from petrochemicals (which is therefore a patentable process) and then further, to develop an artificial derivative which can itself be patented, also. You could take an artificial Flavonoid like Flavopyridol or Ipriflavone, for instance.<br />\nThen it runs all the usual in-vitro and animal in-vivo tests until finally, it comes time to test it on humans, after shelling out an exhorbitant 1.4 million dollars (at last quote I read about) to the FDA for an Investigational New Drug Permit.<br />\nSo then, it designs the clinical trial, recruits trial subjects and screens them according to its requirements, custom designs the placebo and keeps its constituency a secret from everybody including the FDA, controls exactly how the trial is conducted, controls the way it is evaluated and assessed, and controls the way its results are reported.<br />\nThis keeps everything nice and precisely scientific and nothing gets out of hand.<br />\nAnd let&#8217;s not speak of palm-greasing baksheesh behind the scenes, because that never happens &#8211; right? Oops! I spoke of it. Damn&#8230;!<br />\nBut I have a question.<br />\nIsn&#8217;t this a bit like letting the prisoners have the keys to all the prison gates? If you&#8217;re a university student, should you get to write your own examination papers and assess them yourself?<br />\nIs this methodology in the way it is regulated by the FDA genuinely true to scientific method &#8211; or is it more like the political and marketing sciences applied to the nth degree?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5530\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5530\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5530\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 5, 2013 at 12:25 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5530#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5530\", \"5530\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>&#8220;worthwhile stuff&#8221;?

Ed McCabe, commenting on Dr. Hans Nieper&#8217;s remarks about FDA &amp; AMA officials. [Author\u2019s Comment: As of 1998, Ed McCabe was in jail for his campaigning against the medical orthodoxy and was released from custody after serving 18 months. I am not acquainted with precisely what he was convicted of. If I were to hazard a guess, it would likely be for advocating unsanctioned non-pharmaceutical substances for use as actual medical treatments. This is commonly an illegal practice in developed countries. Some such substances may only be advocated as &#8220;health supplements&#8221;, if anything, whilst others like Ozone or DMSO require administration by qualified, licensed medical practitioners, but are (or have previously been) prohibited. Used successfully and legally in Europe for many years, Ozone is now legally used ex-vivo in California by Oasis Of Hope Hospital as a cancer treatment, which signals a recent change for the better. But generally, advocacy laws prohibit promoting agents that are &#8220;not scientifically proven&#8221;. That really means &#8220;not administratively proven in officially approved trials and thereby not fully sanctioned under existing pharmaceutical regulations&#8221;. It has little or nothing whatsoever to do with what is scientifically proven or unproven; and absolutely nothing to do with what is safe and effective, or NOT safe and effective. Money and power are demonstrably more relevant in the provenance of cancer treatments than genuine safety and efficacy.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5549\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5549\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5549\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:01 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5549#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5549\", \"5549\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>9. &#8220;We are not dealing with a scientific problem.

Considering the patients we called inconclusive but for whom we were able to be of some help, it is over 90 percent.<br />\nNow compare our figures with the official (as of early 1983) American Cancer Society figure of 15 percent of patients who are helped by radiation or chemotherapy. (Also, note that the two physicians in our sampling elected not to be treated with radiation or chemotherapy. We find this to be true of practically all the physician-patients who come to our clinic.)<br />\nOf the people we could not help, those who died or are presumed dead, I am willing to state that we probably could have helped these patients had they not come to us with enormously debilitated immune systems resulting from having already undergone massive chemotherapy or radiation. The profound sadness we at the clinic experience when we receive a patient who already is beyond help is only offset by the great joy and satisfaction we feel when so-called terminal patients walk out of our doors after the accepted tests show them to be on the road to recovery, or when the disease is at least controlled to the point where they are able to lead comfortable and normal lives.<br />\nEach patient cited here has been proved to have cancer by a qualified pathologist examining tissue under a microscope. In medicine only this represents the final proof of cancer. Once the diagnosis is firmly established, the metastases or recurrences may be judged by other means, such as X ray, CAT scan, and palpating (feeling) nodules.&#8221; Virginia Livingston Wheeler M.D. (The Conquest of Cancer: Vaccines and Diet p. 18, 19).

American legal authorities (spearheaded by the FDA) have stopped her from using that particular part of her cancer treatment protocol on the false pretext of contamination and anaphylactic risk. In this passage, she states a central, incontrovertible truth: &#8220;&#8230;we probably could have helped these patients had they not come to us with enormously debilitated immune systems from having already undergone massive chemotherapy or radiation.&#8221; The same American medical authorities are NOT stopping the butchers who use chemotherapy and radiation.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5553\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5553\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5553\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:07 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5553#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5553\", \"5553\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>13. &#8220;From different kinds of malignant tumours, good results were achieved in the following cases: mammary cancer, cancer of the prostate, testicles, rectum, ovaries, uterus, larynx, brain tumours, malignant melanoma, Hodgkin&#8217;s disease. (However, tumours with poor vasculation, e.g., tumours of the bones, sarcomas, lymphoadentises, neuroblastomas, etc. do not show satisfactory improvement.) In the case of leukaemias the blood picture of the patient shows fast and lasting improvement, the number of white blood cells decreases to the normal value, the number of platelets increases. Although I did not deal with diseases of different origin, patients and doctors using the Drops observed that they are effective in the following cases as well: lack of appetite, disorder of digestion, fatigability, weakness, insomnia, enfeeblement, persisting headache, anaemia, menstrual and menopausal problems, nausea, asthmatic diseases, bronchitis, child retention problems in pregnancy, cervical lesions, frequent subfebrility and developmental anomalies in children, certain types of diabetes in children and adults, persisting diarrhoeas of non-bacterial origin, vasoconstriction and hypertension, non-traumatic epilepsy, ulcers, arthritis, haemorrhoidal disease, aphtha, pemphigus and multiple sclerosis.<br />\nThe Drops can help 65-70% of the patients suffering from these diseases. Out of this group of patients about 30-35% will be capable of going back to work and lead a normal life. In the case of the remainder (approximately 35%) the question of going back to work does not arise partly because of their advanced age, partly because of the permanent damages caused, e.g. by operations.&#8221; Interview with Dr. Jozsef Beres.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5554\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5554\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5554\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:08 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5554#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5554\", \"5554\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>14. &#8220;Without exception, all the oncologists I talked to about Dr Burzynski were scornful and hostile. Twenty-five years of practising unconventional medicine did not prepare me for what I discovered. Delving into attitudes, actions, and beliefs of modern oncologists was like opening a box of cereal and finding it full of worms. They just don\u2019t care\u2026. The question I kept asking was why, and the answer to that question gradually began to creep out: Dr Burzynski\u2019s discovery threatens one of the largest and most lucrative industries in the history of mankind, the cancer treatment industry.<br />\nAll those radiation machines and doctors who run them<br />\nAll those chemotherapy drugs and the doctors who prescribe them<br />\nAll those so called studies that just juggle the doses of chemo &amp; radiation, and<br />\nAll those surgeons who have been flailing at cancer for over 100 years<br />\nIf it (antineoplastons) is allowed to flourish, it renders obsolete the entire cancer treatment industry. He has discovered a non-toxic treatment that is about as close to cure as we have ever seen. If you think the lumber jacks in the Pacific Northwest were scornful of the spotted owl, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet\u2026.<br />\nAlso it is not just about money, it is about strongly held beliefs, beliefs that have meshed with the personality of virtually everyone in the cancer treatment industry, especially the physicians. In short, these beliefs are that cancer can only be treated with therapies that mutilate, poison, or burn the patient, in the hope that they &#8220;kill&#8221; the cancer\u2026 Therefore, each patient who is miraculously cured by Burzynski\u2019s nontoxic therapy is not viewed as a breakthrough, or even as something good, but rather as a dangerous messenger of heresy, a terrible threat to their beliefs.&#8221; Dr Whitaker, M.D.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5555\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5555\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5555\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:09 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5555#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5555\", \"5555\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>15. &#8220;My investigation to date should convince this Committee that a conspiracy does exist to stop the free flow and use of drugs in interstate commerce which allegedly has solid therapeutic value.

Since 1963, we have been assured that polio vaccines have not contained this deadly contaminant. Stanley Kops shows that not only is this not the case, but that the vaccine regulators who are charged with keeping our families safe, have known all along that SV-40 was never removed from vaccines.&#8221; Meryl W. Dorey. [Author&#8217;s Note: Only the matter of whether the vaccine was actually made free of contamination since 1963 remains unverified and open to question \u2013 all other salient facts in this quote are absolutely accurate. That poses the question, &#8220;Who is telling the truth and was the virus actually removed post 1963?&#8221; Refer to &#8220;DIP&#8221; in the previous Section A of this Chapter \u2013 a methodology for assessing probability of accuracy on the parts of Dorey &amp; Kops Vs. NCI &amp; the Orthodoxy on this question. The inevitable inference to be drawn from it is that the SV-40 contamination was probably not removed. Update: Nowadays, vaccines are made using infected cells bred in laboratories from three aborted human foetuses, according to HSI. I have not yet established when animals ceased to be used for making vaccines, if that is in fact the case. But modern day use of foetal cells throws the door open on a whole new scandal in which the causality of autism in young children (plus a host of other extremely serious autoimmune diseases) is implicated. Human DNA is inherently recombinant in humans, as is viral DNA, whereas animal DNA is not. Daughter cells from recombined DNA exhibit a high degree of genetic incompatibility with the recipient hosts and trigger destructive autoimmune responses on a scale far exceeding that of animal-sourced material. That is not to presume that animal-sourced material (particularly in the form of serum antibody vaccines) doesn\u2019t also trigger autoimmune responses, because it does; merely less frequently. The antibodies (which are proteins encoded in non-human systems, not DNA) are still foreign and shouldn\u2019t be introduced into a human system where they don\u2019t belong.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5558\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5558\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5558\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:24 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5558#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5558\", \"5558\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>18. &#8220;Ozone eliminates&#8230; viruses and bacteria from blood, human and stored&#8230; Medical ozone is successfully used on AIDS, Herpes, Hepatitis, Mononucleosis, Cirrhosis of the liver, Gangrene, Cardiovascular Disease, Arteriosclerosis, High Cholesterol, Cancerous Tumours, Lymphomas, Leukemia&#8230; Highly effective on Rheumatoid and other Arthritis, Allergies of all types&#8230; Improves Multiple Sclerosis, ameliorates Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, Senility, and Parkinson&#8217;s&#8230; Effective on Proctitis, Colitis, Prostrate, Candidiasis, Trichomoniasis, Cystitis.

Cameron gave 10 grams of Vitamin C a day to patients with untreatable, terminal cancer. These patients were then compared by Cameron and me to patients with the same kind of cancer at the same terminal stage who were being treated in the same hospital but by other doctors&#8211;doctors who didn&#8217;t give vitamin C, but instead just gave conventional treatments. Cameron&#8217;s terminal cancer patients lived far longer compared to the ones who didn&#8217;t get 10 grams a day of vitamin C. The other patients lived an average of six months after they were pronounced terminal, while Cameron&#8217;s patients lived an average of about six years.&#8221; Linus Pauling Interview by Peter Chowka 1996 [Author&#8217;s Note: Pauling and Cameron pioneered Vitamin C megadosing, administered intravenously. Mayo Clinic&#8217;s Dr. Charles Moertel subsequently conducted clinical trials of Vitamin C Therapy sponsored by NCI in order to determine the relative benefit of using this type of therapy. The results were not statistically better than orthodox performance at all and Moertel made public statements (and of course, formal reports to medical review boards) to this negative effect. However, it was later found that Moertel fixed the design of the trials. He administered lesser doses of Vitamin C; foreshortened dosage periods so they continued only for a small fraction of the full duration of the trials; gave the vitamin C via oral administration instead of intravenously; and which Pauling and colleagues agree to be a relatively ineffectual route; and is accused of other indiscretions of even more vile nature, for in having cheated the trial&#8217;s design, he allowed patients to die who might otherwise have lived. He is further accused of convincing other patients on the same vitamin C therapy to discontinue it in favour of some filthy orthodox treatment \u2013 resulting in more unjustified deaths. According to Pauling and Cameron, the dosages must be significantly higher; must be administered intravenously; and must not be discontinued in the persisting presence of cancer. Therefore, those Moertel trial results at Mayo Clinic must be taken to be false and corrupt. Moertel and his colleague Creaghan must be considered to be murderers.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5560\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5560\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5560\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 5:27 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5560#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5560\", \"5560\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>20. &#8220;As a retired physician, I can honestly say that unless you are in a serious accident, your best chance of living to a ripe old age is to avoid doctors and hospitals and learn nutrition, herbal medicine and other forms of natural medicine unless you are fortunate enough to have a naturopathic physician available. Almost all drugs are toxic and are designed only to treat symptoms and not to cure anyone. Vaccines are highly dangerous, have never been adequately studied or proven to be effective, and have a poor risk/reward ratio. Most surgery is unnecessary and most textbooks of medicine are inaccurate and deceptive. Almost every disease is said to be idiopathic (without known cause) or genetic &#8211; although this is untrue. In short, our mainstream medical system is hopelessly inept and/or corrupt. The treatment of cancer and degenerative diseases is a national scandal. The sooner you learn this, the better off you will be.&#8221; Dr. Allan Greenberg (Dec 24, 2002). [My research into pharmaceutical drugs fully confirms Dr. Greenberg\u2019s assertion that almost all of them are toxic; and further, that vaccines (plus MABs and rDNAs) are highly dangerous. Even the seemingly innocent Paracetamol is actually the world&#8217;s Number One cause of Liver Failure \u2013 which is fatal; while Aspirin actually kills about one in two thousand chronic users, or about one in thirty thousand people each year overall in developed countries, by causing brain haemorrhage. Additionally, having come to understand the human biology and dynamics of cancer and several other diseases in depth, I can only agree fully that nutrition and natural medicine are cornerstone knowledge bases for anyone who wants to live a long and healthy life.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5567\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5567\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5567\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 10:16 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5567#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5567\", \"5567\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>This is thr funniest &#8230;..

They&#8217;ve been studying effects of two immunomodulating agents on Mesothelioma and other lung cancers, which presumably, though not stated, are SCLC and NSCLC. Complete and permanent cures, where the cancers never return, were indicated. The immunomodulating agents were not named. Apparently, in view of the ongoing research being far from complete, the researchers are playing it close to the chest and not revealing too much. Aloe Vera was mentioned as a source, If there was another source for the second compound, I did not catch it as I listened to the segment. But since Aloe Vera accounts for at least one of the two substances, I can at least name that one with confidence. It is Acetyl-mannan, a long-chain fibre sugar built on mannose units. The researchers speak of the compounds activating macrophages in particular, though I have reason to believe there is a broader spectrum of immune response that engages other types of leucocyte, too. This compound is one of the most potent innate immune system activators known to medical science. Many types of long-chain sugar are known for activating the innate immune system. Beta-1,3-1,6-glucans found in some species of Japanese mushroom such as Shiitake, Maitake and Reishi contain these. Incidentally, although it is totally harmless to humans, Acetyl-mannan is illegal in the US. No surprises there!<br />\nThe researchers have published several papers relating to this work in peer-reviewed journals and they say there has been a good deal of enthusiastic reaction to the results so far achieved in this &#8220;new research&#8221;. In my view, much of what they&#8217;re doing sounded a bit like &#8220;old hat&#8221; to me, since the general properties of Acetyl-mannan at least are already fairly well-known. However, there may be some useful elucidations of biochemical pathways and mechanisms of action emerge from the work that will add to the body of existing knowledge.<br />\nBeyond that, I doubt that when it comes to the crunch, there will ultimately be a formally recognised and approved cancer treatment emerge from it. So, it is likely to become another string of research and means of treatment that goes underground, like so many others have over the last 90 years.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5569\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5569\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5569\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 10:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5569#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5569\", \"5569\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>22. &#8220;We went through the records and we found over five hundred of his patients who were alive and well five years after their treatment, with no cancer.

A very successful treatment for cancer and other degenerative disease. Not because it did not work, but because it was mis-labeled. The US Attorney told my attorney that the FDA wanted me silenced. As a result of this trial my book was banned and a GAG order placed upon my speech.<br />\nJust as the high tide raises all boats, we need again all the public response that we can muster to expose the light of truth of this story, which is born of commitment to working to achieve a goal common to all, persistence and obstinate resistance to crimes against humanity.<br />\nToday America and most other nations are caught in the middle of an epic betrayal; the deadliest of tyrannies or trade wars ever. Today personal choice in medicine may be likened to Henry Ford&#8217;s comment, &#8220;you may have any color car, so long as it&#8217;s black.&#8221; This trade war is not new, but a culmination of a concerted effort focusing its energies particularly since the 1920&#8217;s.<br />\nIn cancer therapy alone 2.5 million Americans die per year, predominantly because they are only allowed &#8220;Allopathic&#8221; methods of treatment, limited to Surgery, Chemicals and Radiation, which are lethal, destructive to the bone marrow, the immune system, the heart, liver or kidney&#8217;s [sic], and carcinogenic.<br />\nThey are dispensed with regular doses of negative reinforcement and/or false hope, cloaked in the term remission between billing cycles.<br />\nInsurance companies are cost plus providers, which have no incentive to reduce costs. They act as &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; and for their role in the monopoly will not pay for any treatment which comes from outside the cartel. This nation is coming to understand this horror is a result of complacency as well as collusion between government agency, pharmaceutical interests and institutional medicine and its powerful financial influence over nearly every facet of the worldwide bureaucracy and mass media.<br />\nFor many years there have been treatments available which are successful and usually NOT harmful for diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, organ regeneration and other diseases. One by one these treatments and their creators or proponents have been targeted by the FDA, which I call the &#8220;office of orthodoxy enforcement,&#8221; illegally using just powers derived from the consent of governed.<br />\nThese forms of tyranny are always accompanied by multi agency intrusions or harassment, confiscation of private medical files, censorship of written materials and threats or prosecution.<br />\nKervorkian has forced the issue into the Second and Ninth Circuits which have ruled that the Sovereign Citizen has a Right to choose the time and manner of his/her death. This Fall, we will argue in the Second Circuit that denial of access is the equivalent of passive genocide, and that the concomitant Right must also exist, the manner in which you choose to preserve life.<br />\nThere is much more to share, should you have an interest, we have done much research in the area of passive genocide through FDA programs. We have an exceptional chance of success; however, to win this battle, I need your help too! Conversely, if I can be of service, you may call upon me at any time.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nCharles Pixley.&#8221; Charles Pixley, National Executive Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians. [When reviewing Cancer Quotes, I decided it was time to find out precisely who Charles Pixley was and what were his credentials. The original quoted text here was that now shown in dark blue (from Cancer Tutor) and \u201cCharles Pixley\u201d appeared as the source with no additional information. I presumed he was an investigator. When I punched up the name in the Firefox search field, it returned several hits and the first yielded the full text of his quote and his position in the organization named above. I can now fairly safely presume that he is a practising physician as well as a founder of this Association of Eclectic Physicians. Clearly, he also has an active association with the famous microbiologist, Gaston Naessens of Canada. From another letter by Charles Pixley, I derived eight more quotes \u2013 #155, #156, #157, #158, #159, #160, #161 &amp; #162. Like so many other quotes reproduced in this series, they lividly show the FDA up for what it is \u2013 a rotten-to-the-core clique of inhuman, passively genocidal criminals, who are, for all practical intents and purposes, effectively owned and bankrolled by the pharmaceutical cartel. The outcome of the Second/Ninth Circuit hearings was unsatisfactory: something to the effect of, \u201cWe are reluctant to set new precedents on this matter\u201d, so despite previous and direct legal precedents in this very stream, the \u201cconcomitant right\u201d to choose one&#8217;s manner or methodology of preserving human life, was not supported, reasserted or enshrined by the courts. The judges elected to ignore the relevance or status of those prior cases of legal precedence. One would have thought that in a benevolent democracy, such a Right should be considered automatic and inalienable, but here is evidence that it is not.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5571\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5571\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5571\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 10:49 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5571#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5571\", \"5571\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>24. &#8220;There had been a head of the AMA (who later turned out to be a fraud) his name was Fishbein and he was rampantly opposed to any alternative therapy.

Three and four weeks after beginning the zeolite treatment, their overall condition was significantly improved. They suffered much less pain and were able to breathe and move without difficulty.

That means, they exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and in addition, exhibit anticarcinomic action as a flow-on effect (5-LPO commonly characterises a good many cancer cell lines). They are used in a number of topical anti-inflammatory and pain-killing formulas to very good effect.

That is called a response rate, so you have a response&#8230;(but) when you look to see if there is any life prolongation from taking this treatment what you find is all kinds of hocus pocus and song and dance about the disease free survival, and this and that. In the end there is no proof that chemotherapy in the vast majority of cases actually extends life, and this is the GREAT LIE about chemotherapy, that somehow there is a correlation between shrinking a tumour and extending the life of the patient.&#8221; Dr. Ralph Moss, PhD (former publicist for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital.) [Although Ralph is not a medical doctor and his PhD is a classic one, he is nevertheless correct. All over the internet, you will find hundreds of CAM experts (especially practising naturopaths and maverick medical doctors) stating flatly and vehemently that there&#8217;s no significant correlation. And they back it up with reliable science. Time and again, Cancer&#8217;s Answers states that killing cancer cells is not the main solution, because it does not correct the cause of the disease; and because in the cases of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it destroys the body&#8217;s constitution and its innate ability to restore the internal biological balance. So usually, chemotherapy makes things worse. Slaughtering large numbers of cells, whether healthy or malignant, actually presents deadly dangers such as increased virulence and TLS \u2013 not solutions.

It is the utter lack of certainty as to the outcome of conventional treatment that virtually screams for more freedom of choice in the area of cancer therapy. Yet most so-called alternative therapies regardless of potential or proven benefit, are outlawed, which forces patients to submit to the failures we know don\u2019t work, because there is no other choice. &#8220;The FDA, NCI and ACS, and the large treatment centres work to eliminate choice of cancer therapies, particularly better ones. They openly attack breakthroughs made by &#8220;mavericks&#8221;, which they define as anyone outside their ranks. Folks, any serious study of how these entities work together to destroy hopeful approaches to cancer reveals a trail of corruption, conspiracy, dishonesty, and inhumanity that warrants designation of evil\u2026. We continue to use them not because they work, but because those who perform them have so vigorously eliminated any other choice.<br />\nFirst, I would not even check in with a conventional oncologist, particularly not one from a prominent cancer institution. Their expertise is in implementing the erroneous paradigm that cancer must be purged from the body with toxic methods. This, in my opinion, is no more valuable than maps from the Flat Earth Society. When there is a paradigm shift&#8212;and we definitely are in the middle of one with cancer treatment&#8212;those sitting on the lofty perches of authority are the last to make the change, because they are guarding the paradigm about to be replaced. I don\u2019t buy maps of a flat earth, and I wouldn\u2019t go to the NCI or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Centre for cancer treatment.<br />\nI\u2019d turn my back on 50 years of institutionalised expertise, because it follows the wrong paradigm. Everything that is done in medicine today or in any other discipline fits some paradigm. The paradigm I use for cancer is that it is a systemic problem in which the normal control mechanisms of your body are altered. Your immune system likely bears the largest burden for this control; thus, all techniques that enhance it are promising. Those that damage it are not.&#8221; Julian Whitaker, MD. [Author&#8217;s Note: I reproduced one sentence of this quote in bold. Read it again. It&#8217;s the first and most important piece of good advice you will ever receive concerning cancer. NCI and ACS maintain websites, which I have myself visited for the purpose of garnering and analysing information about cancer and its treatments. In my Websites Directory of the Appendices, I have recorded comments and accordingly rated these sites, amongst others. Of course, after studying vast amounts of material, I openly state that I am in agreement with Dr. Whitaker&#8217;s statements regarding these organisations (plus others, including MSK and Mayo). Doctor Whitaker is not alone amongst medicos and scientists in making such statements against these institutions, either. I personally recommend that you firstly see my comments on the NCI and ACS websites; and then visit them yourself \u2013 in doing so, I believe you can only draw the same conclusions as those of Doctor Whitaker and myself. And it happens that Dr. Whitaker&#8217;s analysis of control mechanism failure (largely borne by the Immune System) as being the engine of cancer proliferation is absolutely, if  conditionally correct. The one caveat one needs to understand is that behind all this is a fundamental microbial cause \u2013 viruses and microbes. It follows for various reasons that his resultant treatment paradigm is without question the correct one, also.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5588\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5588\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">responding to continious posting of utter rubbish</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5588\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 12:18 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5588#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5588\", \"5588\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to responding to continious posting of utter rubbish'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>another quotation &#8211; and meaningless<br />\nPrint some evidence</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5585\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5585\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5585\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 11:19 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5585#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5585\", \"5585\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>36. &#8220;There is no better example of the weakness of our dominant medicine than its clearly ineffective War on Cancer. There is no better example of the superiority of a complementary approach than in the management of this dread disease\u2026. We are equally concerned about whether mainstream medicine\u2019s demand for proof works to maintain it at its current level of ineptitude.&#8221; Dr. Atkins, M.D. [That&#8217;s the opposite side of the same coin. No, the demand for proof does not work in the same way for pharmaceutical or other orthodox treatments. If it did, there&#8217;d be no such drugs for cancer treatment as Mustard Gas derivatives, Platins, Anthracyclines, MABs or a host of other dangerous poisons. In point of fact, it&#8217;s not a demand for proof, but a demand instead for huge fortunes, that masquerades as a demand for proof. This is particularly so in view of the quality of proof required for a pharmaceutical drug to gain FDA approval. It is borne by the fact that clinical trials for an IND (Investigational New Drug) are conceived, designed, recruitment screened, conducted, assessed and reported on by none other than the pharmaceutical corporations seeking their approval \u2013 AND their placebos, which are not truly placebos at all, are also custom formulated and kept absolutely secret, even from the FDA.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5589\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5589\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">responding to continious posting of utter rubbish</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5589\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 6, 2013 at 12:19 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5589#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5589\", \"5589\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to responding to continious posting of utter rubbish'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>another quotation .

They never eat a dried apricot without enclosing the seed between them. This supplies them with better than average of 50 to 75 milligrams of Vitamin B17 a day. There are many of us in the Western World who don&#8217;t ingest this amount of Vitamin B17 in the course of an entire year. As a result we&#8217;re in the midst of a fulminating deficiency of Vitamin B17 or nitriloside, the anti-neoplastic vitamin. Its absence from our diets accounts for the fact that cancer in our population has reached such a pandemisity as to account for its occurrence in one in every three American families.&#8221; Ernst Krebs. [The vitamin status of Amygdalin, Laetrile or Linamarin is disputed by most scientists and in addition, it has been claimed that Dr. Krebs named it Vitamin B17 in order to capitalise commercially on the Vitamin supplement craze which was burgeoning at around that time. But when one examines all the other vitamins and even just those of the B Group alone, one finds a chemical diversity that defies understanding \u2013 they are mostly complexes: that is, substances comprising two or more distinct types of basic molecular chemicals and in this, these three nitrilosides are no exceptions. By definition, a vitamin is an essential substance the body MUST have in order to maintain health \u2013 and which the lack of results in a specific deficiency disease. Scurvy, Ricketts and Pellagra are but three examples. In most cases, these are substances that the body cannot synthesise itself. Vitamin D is a peculiar exception, since it is naturally synthesised in human skin with UVB. Technically, it is therefore not an \u201cEssential Vitamin\u201d, since to qualify for that descriptor, it must be one which the body cannot synthesise otself and must acquire from external nutritional sources. If we accept Dr. Krebs&#8217;s assertion that Amygdalin is a genuine anticarcinomic and that its deficiency is conducive to cancer, then it should technically qualify as a vitamin and indeed, an \u201cEssential Vitamin\u201d on the additional basis that the body cannot synthesise it. So the qualification of what is or isn&#8217;t a true Vitamin does seem somewhat arbitrary. The Hunza do in fact enjoy longer lives (up to 120 years is common). They also enjoy far lower cancer incidence rates AND far higher cancer survival rates, despite having very poor access to orthodox medicine (or rather perhaps thanks to poor access). That further legitimises Dr. Krebs&#8217;s claim. However, a situation has arisen whereby the substance itself was systematically discredited through manipulated publicity and systematically disapproved within the medical and pharmaceutical system, regardless of its true vitamin status or its real efficacy \u2013 especially through corrupted medical trials at MSK. Finally, it is in fact a provenly effective anticarcinomic and when used correctly via IV infusion, surprisingly safe.

I have no information about what happened to Kanematsu, but it is probable that his career was crashed and burned by MSK.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5613\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5613\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5613\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 3:57 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5613#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5613\", \"5613\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>43. &#8220;Since I had never been seriously ill, I wondered if my (cancer) condition had anything to do with the death of my son. Three years later, as chief of internal medicine in a so-called gynecology-oncology clinic at Munich University, I had the opportunity to study female patients with cancer and to compare my findings to see if the mechanism was the same as mine; if they too had experienced such a terrible shock. I found that all of them, without exception, had experienced the same type of biological conflict as I had. They were able to recollect the shock, the resulting sleeplessness, weight loss, cold hands and the beginning of tumor growth. At the time, my point of view was very different from all the current medical concepts, and when I presented these discoveries to my colleagues, they gave me an ultimatum: either to deny my findings or leave the clinic immediately.&#8221; Dr. Hamer (website source redacted) [The condition referred to in this quote is sure to be what psychiatrists call \u201cPost Traumatic Stress Disorder\u201d. Central Nervous System disorders of this kind, to which we can add Chronic Depression, Bipolar and some other disorders are known to associate with abnormally low levels of healthy cell signalling compounds and correspondingly high levels of problematic ones. A major and almost inevitable effect of such systemic biochemical imbalance is Immune System dysfunction, resulting in a host of susceptibilities \u2013 to such afflictions as infection, obesity, diabetes and cancer \u2013 and the victim\u2019s inability to combat the conditions satisfactorily.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5614\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5614\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5614\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 3:57 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5614#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5614\", \"5614\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>44. &#8220;As a chemist trained to interpret data, it is incomprehensible to me that physicians can ignore the clear evidence that chemotherapy does much, much more harm than good.&#8221; Alan Nixon, Ph.D., Past President, American Chemical Society.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5615\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5615\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5615\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 3:58 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5615#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5615\", \"5615\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>45. &#8220;It amazes me how much of what passes for knowledge in cancer therapy turns out to be incomplete, inadequate, and anecdotal.&#8221; Ralph Moss, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>46. &#8220;Your toxic concoctions (chemo) are actually the false hope you worry so much about.&#8221; William Kelley Eidem, author &#8220;The Doctor Who Cures Cancer&#8221;.</p>\n<p>47. &#8220;Two to 4% of cancers respond to chemotherapy\u2026\u2026The bottom line is for a few kinds of cancer, chemo is a life extending procedure&#8212;Hodgkin&#8217;s disease, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Testicular cancer and Choriocarcinoma.&#8221; Ralph Moss, Ph.D. 1995 Author of Questioning Chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>48. &#8220;A combination of laetrile, Gerson, enzymes and Coley type vaccines would cure over 95% of cancers.&#8221; Frank Hourigan, co-author with Dick Richards, M.D. of The Good News on Cancer.</p>\n<p>49. &#8220;This (Coley\u2019s toxins) is really an effective treatment and it&#8217;s an OUTRAGEOUS crime of the century that we at MSK were able to cure cancer a 100 years ago that they can&#8217;t cure today.&#8221; Ralph Moss</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5616\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5616\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5616\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 4:00 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5616#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5616\", \"5616\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>50. &#8220;Medications are palliatives. They are not designed to cure the degenerative diseases of the body.&#8221; F. Batmanghelidj, M.D. [That is a perfectly accurate assessment in the vast majority of cases. Only very recently have some pharmaceutical drugs begun to emerge on the market with some partial ability to cure. An example is the latest drug for the treatment of viral Hepatitis \u2013 particularly HBV &amp; HCV. Success rate is claimed to be in the order of 90% and side effects are claimed to be minimal and easily tolerated. How true these claims are in reality still definitely remains to be seen. The drug is based on recombinant DNA. I have not examined it closely, but I strongly suspect it may use an engineered virus as the carrier. If that surmise is correct, it must surely throw up a new spectre of possible danger. Playing with engineered viruses opens a veritable Pandora&#8217;s Box of potentially dangerous unknowns, especially with recombinant DNA. Some MABs produce cures in cancer and other diseases, but there is a terrible cost in fatalities and the infliction of permanent autoimmune diseases. Addendum November 2012: A personal friend of mine was administered this new and allegedly safe hepatitis treatment. It nearly killed her and no, it did not wipe out the HCV \u2013 only some 95% of it. Before very long, the viral infection would have returned to its previous levels of severity.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5618\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5618\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5618\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 4:38 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5618#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5618\", \"5618\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>To blog readers here, I should perhaps confess I&#8217;m having some fun, here. Lots more to come and although they are quotations (hardly original, of course) they do form a compelling body of evidence, even if they don&#8217;t meet the &#8220;strict&#8221; standards of &#8220;proof&#8221; that have given us such wonder drugs as Vioxx, Avandia, Neurontin, nitrogen mustards, anthracyclines, nitrosoureas, platins, MABs and rDNAs. Yet even then, the comments point to a host of excellent alternative medicine modalities and with my own footnotes, also form a body of information about various useful things to know such as aspects of the human biology and so forth.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to speak of pharmaceutical contrivances a bit more, here.</p>\n<p>Until recently, approximately 25% of pharmaceutical drugs were derived from natural agents isolated from plants or some other natural sources. They would be isolated after the whole plant or other whole biological entity/substance was tested and tested individually &#8211; usually in-vitro. The most active isolates would then be concentrated and a chemical process would be developed for each to duplicate it artificially. Oh, but that&#8217;s not much good commercially, because the competition can still easily market the same stuff. So they take each one and treat it with chemical reagents, such as nitric or hydrochloric acids with buffers to nitrify or chlorinate these substnaces. In many cases, they may also methylate, acetylate or polyphenylate them &#8211; or some such modification &#8211; any modification that will produces a range of derivatives which do not occur in Nature. These can be patented and therefore protected from plagiarism under law. They are progressively eliminated from contention as the &#8220;new drug&#8221; on the basis of &#8220;efficacy&#8221; and &#8220;safety&#8221; through a series of further comparative tests in-vitro and some in-vivo using animal models. The most efficacious and safest ones don&#8217;t necessarily make the selection cut. They may instead be held in escrow, but that&#8217;s another aspect of the story I won&#8217;t go into, here. The prime determinant is PROFITABILITY POTENTIAL.Finally, the successful contender is put to regulating authority approval by the usual routes &#8211; IND permit, phase I, II &amp; III trials etc.</p>\n<p>But because of the nature of the chemistry involved in producing drugs by this route of derivation from natural substances, it&#8217;s relatively easy from a chemical technology standpoint. Plagiarisation still takes place and the plagiarists need only use similar chemical means to slightly modify the drug a little more &#8211; and it can even get past patent protection. Yet in m any third world countries, that is hardly necessary, if patent laws hold no sway there.</p>\n<p>So more and more, the heavyweights in the pharmaceutical business are moving away from Nature altogether and concentrating as much as possible instead upon higher drug technologies that only the big boys can do. So even TKI/CDKI drugs like Lestaurtinib, Gefitinib and so on are rapidly becoming unfashionable as they rely more upon Monoclonal Antibodies and Recombinant DNA drugs. These are NOT easily plagiarised, at all.</p>\n<p>That approximate 25% natural derivation figure is already in decline and the decline will accelerate as Pharma moves more and more towards super-high-tech drugs.</p>\n<p>Little men in white coats with their chemistry sets are becoming so supremely arrogant nowadays, that they think they can outdo Nature and become as gods.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5620\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5620\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5620\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 6:52 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5620#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5620\", \"5620\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>One of the great misunderstandings in cancer medicine is that one must come up with the treatment that is effectively hostile to cancer cells. Even the efficacy of natural/CAM/Integrative modalities are often expressed in these terms, such as in the case that alkalising the body makes the environment hostile to cancer cells. Well, that&#8217;s true enough from that particular perspective, but in the broader picture, it is really a case of applying &#8220;bio-friendly&#8221; principles and treatments like nutrition and so on to normalise what I call the Biodynamic Balance. (This embraces homeostasis,and more.) Such a condition is naturally and inherently hostile to malignancy. Here is a significant element of the distinction between a sound medical paradigm and a false one. Chemo and radiation are simply not bio-friendly and consequently do massive collateral damage, which the patient must additionally struggle with &#8211; things like myelosuppression, immunosuppression and toxicity in particular. False medical paradigm. Bad science &#8211; with ALL the clinical trial proof to its vile credit. Surgery has a legitimate place in medicine, but its limitations must be recognised and regarded with appropriate reserve.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be off for perhaps a week or so. Then I&#8217;ll be back to put more salt on the boojum&#8217;s tail. Heaps more.

Crawford, Acting FDA Commissioner. &#8220;This sentence sends a strong message that we will not tolerate marketing of bogus medicines.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following the investigation by FDA, the USAO, and the USPIS, the U.S. District Court for Eastern District of New York placed Vale&#8217;s illegal sales and promotion of Laetrile &#8212; also known as amygdalin, &#8220;Vitamin B-17&#8221;, or apricot pits &#8212; under injunction in April 2000. Defying the court order, Vale set up a shell corporation in Arizona, and continued to ship the product from the basement of his own home to customers passed on to him by his New York firm. For these activities, Vale was found guilty 11 months ago of three counts of criminal contempt, and ordered to be held without bail pending his sentencing.</p>\n<p>Last week, the court also found that Vale, who had made at least $500,000 from his illegal sales of Laetrile, had committed fraud in his marketing of Laetrile. In addition, Vale defrauded the U.S. government by claiming that he qualified for Legal Aid. As a result, Vale was ordered to reimburse the government $31,000 for the costs of his appointed defense attorney.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5630\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5630\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">some real cases</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5630\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 7, 2013 at 12:17 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5630#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5630\", \"5630\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to some real cases'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>A prominent Los Angeles doctor who claimed that specially-prepared herbal supplements could treat a wide variety of diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014 with a success rate as high as 80 percent \u2014 has been convicted and sentenced to prison.</p>\n<p>BLOG: In Twist, Fake Medicine Could Save Rare Animals</p>\n<p>Christine Daniel, a Pentecostal minister, sold her miracle cures through her San Fernando Valley clinic and on the Christian Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) show Praise the Lord.

Mrs. King died on January 30, 2006, of pneumonia, the result of complications from advanced ovarian cancer. She had entered an &#8220;alternative&#8221; medical facility in Rosarito, just south of Tijuana.</p>\n<p>The circumstances of Mrs. King&#8217;s death were doubly painful for me. First, the Kings had inspired my own involvement in the civil rights movement. (I marched with Dr. King and became a community poverty-program organizer in rural Georgia.) And second, I had personally investigated the quack-medicine scene in Mexico.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2003, assisted by fellow investigator Vaughn Rees, I had gone undercover to Tijuana, posing as a terminally ill cancer patient. One hospital we visited offered homeopathic treatments.

On October 17, 2006, he pleaded guilty to a conflict of interest and false reporting of information about stocks he owned in food, beverage and medical device companies he was in charge of regulating. He received a sentence of three years of supervised probation and a fine of about $90,000. From 1978 to 1980 and from 1982 to 1985 Crawford was director of the FDA&#8217;s Center for Veterinary Medicine. From 1987 to 1991 Crawford was administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. From 1997 to 2002, he was Director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, based at Georgetown University before moving to Virginia Tech in 2001. Previously in his career he was chair of the Department of Physiology-Pharmacology at the University of Georgia, executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association, executive director of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, and a practising veterinarian. Crawford served as a FDA Deputy Commissioner since February 25, 2002, and served as acting Commissioner for some of this time. He cannot have been instrumental as a kingpin in the FDA actions against Greg Caton, but might possibly have been influential in the mammography device scandal cited by the \u201cFDA Nine\u201d group of dissident scientists and physicians in their whistle-blowing letters of complaint to President Obama, plus numerous senators and congressmen. Certainly he was in a position to do something positive about them, yet did not. Moreover, it cannot be theorised that these goings on were unknown to him, because he was in the thick of it all for many years as a very senior FDA executive. It is also widely accepted that processed foods are nutritionally deficient in general; and I further cite the terrible nutritional frauds that have been perpetrated through the last several decades. Yet here we find this crooked fellow in the executive vice-presidency of the National Food Processors Association representing commercial interests of this powerful lobby group, while also holding conflicting positions as administrator in the US Department of Agriculture and Director of the Center of Food and Nutrition Policy, as well as the FDA. His short tenure may have been due to the fact that he wasn\u2019t one of Big Pharma\u2019s plants as the great majority have been, so it may have been they who got the dirt on him in order to replace him as FDA Commissioner with one of their own crooked agents. After all, that\u2019s exactly how things work in America.<br />\nIn due course, I&#8217;ll post some more interesting stuff about the FDA &#8211; especially from the mouth of another of its own Commissioners (Dr. Ley) and the &#8220;FDA Nine&#8221;.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5717\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5717\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5717\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 11:00 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5717#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5717\", \"5717\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Didn&#8217;t Steve McQueen use Laetrile why not rather than start more diversion tactics answer any of the points raised?

There is an unquestionable symbiosis between species of the various kingdoms. When one uses a medicinal herb, there is not one single active ingredient, but a multiplicity of them, so whilst one compound in particular may be the most active for the treatment of a given health condition, its exclusive use can sometimes be as problematic as using a pharmaceutical drug. The many other substances present in a given herb are so often found to provide broader efficacies, synergies and rebalancing effects that can compensate for the unbalancing effects or shortcomings of some individual active compounds. For this reason, whole herbs or their extracts are almost invariably superior to single purified compounds or their artificial derivatives.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5721\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5721\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5721\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 11:54 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5721#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5721\", \"5721\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>52. &#8220;At your next dinner party, try playing the following game.

Besides Fishbein and despite Thornton\u2019s criticism of the thug, that two-dollar damages award doesn\u2019t exactly cover Judge Thornton with laurels, either. The obvious inference to be drawn from the outcome of the Hoxsey Vs. Fishbein case was that Thornton was either successfully bought or threatened by some very influential entities. It effectively put Hoxsey out of business, which was the whole aim of the game. So the enemy lost the case, but still won, anyway.

Most of the research has been done on cancers of the digestive tract.&#8221; Dr. Shulze.</p>\n<p>70. &#8220;Pharmaceutical drugs are killing hundreds of thousands of people every year\u2026In spite of that, they claim that two people were hurt with chaparral, so they have taken it off the market. And these claims aren\u2019t even substantiated.&#8221;  Dr. Shulze. [An American study put the death toll from properly prescribed and administered pharmaceutical drugs at around 100,000 annually and some sources quote 160,000 or 180,000 and one even cites a figure of 400,000. The annual number of people seriously affected by such drugs exceeds 2 million (this appears to be agreed upon by most sources); but do you know that cancer allegedly kills 2.5 million Americans annually? In Quote #171, the official 1988 to 1989 figures cited were 809 and 6,407, which shows a very big discrepancy with the study mentioned here. Did the American Association of Poison Control Centers play the numbers down big-time? Or did this study I speak of hugely exaggerate? Whichever the case, the AAPCC numbers are too inexcusably high, even at 809 deaths &amp; 6,407 seriously affected. Knowing what I know about pharmaceutical corporations, their organisational infiltration tactics and their drugs in general, AAPCC is in the pockets of the pharmaceutical cartel and is deliberately playing down the real numbers. Careless dosing with Chaparral can result in death \u2013 that much is true. Whilst it is not an intrinsically toxic herb, its major active constituent is NDGA, a potent \u201cdetox\u201d chelating compound, which mobilises poisons like Mercury out of the adipose tissues into the blood and lymph. However, it does not complete the detox function by neutralising or conjugating the toxins and then finally removing them from the system. The Liver must complete the job. If there is more toxin mobilisation than the Liver can cope with, one has a Herxheimer&#8217;s Syndrome (toxaemia) situation to cope with. In severe cases, this can be lethal. St. John&#8217;s Wort can aid Chaparral&#8217;s role significantly by accelerating liver function in the detox role, but my research indicates that Clinoptilolite and/or MCP are far superior choices.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5728\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5728\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5728\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 12:13 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5728#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5728\", \"5728\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>71. &#8220;Tests showed cancer of the larynx and the doctor advised an operation immediately.

The second greatest cancer breakthrough of the 20th century is the metabolic organic effect on malignant tumours of correcting the body fluid pH to a non-acidic pH 7.1 to 7.5. A neutral pH 7.0 resists cancer formation. An acid body fluid pH of 6.44 and below permits tumours to biochemically become malignant. At pH 7.5 cancer may become inactive; at 8.5 tumours may disintegrate.&#8221; Dr. Carson. [Keep the systemic (whole body) pH within the 7.1 to 7.5 range. It can be higher if entirely localised to the tumours in question and that requires the pH elevating agents to become insoluble once delivered into the tumours and thus remain there; or to react as needed within the tumours and thus lose their high pH before dispersing into the rest of the body (such as with Black Salve). Systemic pH levels above 7.5 are otherwise harmful to more than just tumours and this is potentially dangerous. High levels of Omega fatty acids and the endogenous antioxidants SOD, CoQ10 and Glutathione can offset this problem on a system-wide scale, but a systemic pH above 7.5 is still NOT recommended.

Being thus oriented in the &#8220;market&#8221;, it would be anathema to expect MSK to radically change its policy, whether to examine Revici&#8217;s protocols constructively \u2013 OR to develop any new treatments of its own with any view to improving cancer practices, unless its own trade began to fail. Interestingly, something of this sort has actually begun to happen since Oasis Of Hope Hospital set up shop in San Diego circa 2006. Perhaps MSK has undergone a change in management and/or policy, because this erstwhile paragon of oncological corruption has finally begun to improve its treatments in the face of superior competition. Nevertheless, it still lags so badly behind the current state of the art that it doesn\u2019t even come close to qualifying as a respectably effective cancer treatment institution.

Toxicity with heavy metals such as Mercury is only one case in point, where these metals become bound up with Calcium complexes in order to neutralise them. The complexes are in turn stored in tissues \u2013 particularly the artery walls, which become hardened by the buildup; and as such, Calcium is diverted from other important uses.

I have not yet been able to accurately ascertain the risk level of anaphylaxia associated with IAT. Certainly, it could not possibly be any worse than occurs with the use of Monoclonal Antibodies and immunisation vaccines. If the proteins used come from the patient&#8217;s own blood \u2013 then anaphylaxia is NOT a risk factor, but statements have been made to the effect that multiple blood donor sera are used and this represents a potentially serious risk.

Other health disorders are also vaguely associated with 50 Hz electromagnetic fields. Then there are the geospheric frequencies known as Schumann Resonances, which are considered beneficial to the human biology, if not actually necessary. There can be no questioning the fact that resonant wave energies do affect biological systems in various ways, being dependent upon frequency and field intensity. They can set up sympathetic resonances in those biological systems. Many effects of these wave energies are not certifiably known, or are poorly understood, but should not be discounted without due consideration for the possibilities they represent.

Did the NCI pick up the tab for completing his research? Did the ACS help with favourable publicity? Of course not. The minute NCI saw evidence of antineoplastons working they distorted the data by withdrawing the 2 successful patients and thus the evidence. NCI\u2019s conduct towards him is a striking example of how an agency presumed to be objective can set up a study that will either prove or disprove anything it wants. In this case, there is clear evidence that NCI wanted to prove antineoplastons didn\u2019t work.&#8221; John Diamond, M.D. &amp; Lee Cowden, M.D. [The NCI used both MSK and Mayo to conduct these corrupted trials. There was a litany of dirty tricks on NCI\u2019s part involving broadening the terms of the trial to include patients with much more advanced diseases against Burzynski\u2019s objections. Burzynski insisted that the more advanced patients needed much heavier doses of antineoplastons and as such, should not be part of that particular trial. NCI ignored him and carried on with its own agenda, using antineoplastons supplied by Burzynski under the original agreement, yet in direct breach of that same agreement. They underdosed other patients, too. Meanwhile, the FDA and Texas Medical Board kept him occupied with repeated legal prosecutions whilst NCI and a former understudy of Burzynski\u2019s snuck in under cover of those legal proceedings, plagiarised his work, then applied for and were granted a large number of antineoplaston patents that were already claimed to be held by Burzynski. All this happened in the 1990s. See Burzynski case quotes #144 to #150.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5737\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5737\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5737\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 12:45 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5737#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5737\", \"5737\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>100. &#8220;I\u2019ve looked at cases of chronic myeloid anaemia and chronic lymphoid leukaemia and found without exception you didn\u2019t find a case without you having three different types of radiation present and that was the outside edge line of an underground stream, two-banded Hartman, which was negative in its polarity and AC pos magnetic fields over three hundred nano-tesla. The last four cases of chronic myeloid lymphoid leukaemia the AC field part of the equation was supplied by a transformer and they varied. When you measured them in the area of the bed from just over 300, one was 1100, one was 3,400, the other was around 800, in association with water.&#8221; Alf Riggs [The forms of radiation described in this passage and in Quote #103 are beyond my present knowledge base, so I cannot comment much on their validity, other than to indicate that Riggs quoted measured magnetic flux densities (Nanotesla). That clearly means magnetic fields and in this case, geomagnetic fields. I like to think of myself as someone who knows a bit about wave energies, but even when I searched out material concerning Curry and Hartman Grids, I initially found myself out of my depth. Apparently, so are most university experts, so I don\u2019t feel so bad about it and less so since Alf says the Curry and Hartman Radiation Grids are almost extinct. My attention was drawn to one thing of very special interest, however. I\u2019d often previously heard of lethal radiation in the magnetosphere that should have made the manned moon missions impossible, at least according to conspiracy theorists who allege that the Apollo missions were a huge hoax.  However, Alf Riggs mentioned that NASA overcame the earlier problem, by installing equipment in space capsules, which emitted three types of radiation to counteract the effects upon humans. The equipment replaced the earthbound energies the astronauts were otherwise removed from and these supposedly interacted successfully with the Van Allen fields. Astronauts no longer became sick. It suggests to me that the sickness phenomenon is not purely and simply related with the Van Allen fields, but with the absence of the Geomagnetic fields. After all, I believed it should be quite readily possible for spacecraft to be shielded from Van Allen radiation. In 2013, NASA&#8217;s Curiosity Rover mission to Mars returned radiation data indicating that such manned spaceflights of extended duration would be likely to result in astronauts contracting cancer and other radiation-related diseases. Currently, I fail to understand why other forms of solar and cosmic radiation could not also be shielded by some means. One type of geomagnetic radiation is called the Schumann Wave, named after Professor Winfried Otto Schumann who mathematically predicted and discovered it in 1952, although Nikola Tesla had some limited knowledge of it circa 1899. Schumann Resonance is the one of special interest, for it is said to be an extremely beneficial energy to the human biology and was even listed by Jim Bare in his mighty work I called the Huge List of Rife Machine Frequencies (reproduced in Chapter 06D3). Again, almost nobody in the universities knew anything about this form of radiation and apart from NASA, only Berkeley University had equipment able to detect and measure it. Its primary or base frequency is 7.83 Hz, but it has a number of harmonic frequencies. See Quote #173. 1 Tesla = 1 Weber (Magnetic Flux) per square metre.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5738\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5738\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5738\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 12:55 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5738#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5738\", \"5738\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>101. &#8220;Dr. Pinto explained that his parents had both been dentists. His father had attended a conference in the 1920s at which a speaker had condemned mercury. The elder Pinto remembered this a while later when he was asked to treat a child dying of leukemia. Her biggest complaint was that her gums hurt. He removed her amalgams quietly, and the terminally ill child responded within a few days. &#8220;Spontaneous remission!&#8221; announced the medical profession. Pinto responded by telling the physician he had removed the amalgams. There was a pecking order at that time, just as there is today, in the health professions. He was academically whiplashed and made to feel inferior and foolish. This was standard procedure. So Pinto quietly replaced an amalgam in the little girl, then told the doctor to watch for a recurrence of the leukemia the next day. There was a recurrence. He removed it, of course, and the child recovered again.&#8221; Hal Huggins DDS.</p>\n<p>102. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been dealing with feline leukemia for years; and I get disgusted with most vets, who advocate Test and Slaughter \u2013 that is, if the cat tests positive, it&#8217;s best to kill it. We&#8217;ve had cats who have been able to climb trees and look normal in less than ten weeks. And I&#8217;m talking about cats who were brought in to us when they were too weak even to stand up.&#8221; S. Allen Price, D.V.M..</p>\n<p>103. &#8220;Regarding the geobiological connection between earth radiation and chronic disease, in particular cancer, it could be shown, as already reported two years ago, but now with even greater precision, that at least the starting cause of these diseases is very closely connected with the radiation complex habitually found in cancer zones and at cancer points. Here it was found again and again that the so-called double Curry zones, in connection with radiation from water, but sometimes also without this, were the main cause. Of approx 600 cancer cases which I investigated, there were less than 5% which had no connection with the radiation situation outlined above. In my book which is to be published in the autumn of this year there will be a rich choice of case histories in the form of radiation sketches, and I shall also report in detail on the mystery of &#8220;geomancy&#8221;.&#8221; Hofrat Prof Dr Emil Worsch. [Alf Riggs has made exhaustive studies in this field, also \u2013 which embrace not only the Curry zones, but the Hartman Grid and Schumann Resonances. I see some merit in the concept, but am not qualified to support or oppose the assertions. I am inclined to suspect that these Curry zones and the Hartman Grid effects might relate to the magnetic interaction of the earth&#8217;s nickel-iron core with flux-concentrating seams in the earth&#8217;s crust. They may be nearly extinct, but something suggests to me that these phenomena may wax and wane over the millennia as the earth&#8217;s magnetic poles shift.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5739\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5739\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5739\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 12:58 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5739#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5739\", \"5739\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>104. &#8220;So we took out those 3 root canals when she had 3-6 months to live.

Meanwhile, the safety of Mercury-Silver dental amalgams as alleged by orthodox medicine and dental practice associations in particular is a major health fraud. Its use is not only associated with increased incidence of Leukaemia, but a pandemic of other diseases. Both are fairly reactive metals, but it is the Mercury, which slowly leaches into the system and is highly toxic, that causes the trouble. Silver getting into the system at comparable levels is actually beneficial, especially against bacteria. Despite the known toxicity of Mercury, there is open denial that it actually does leach into the system from the amalgam \u2013 they falsely claim the amalgam is inert. And they are able to accuse any number of other extraneous Mercury sources as being responsible when someone shows elevated internal Mercury concentrations \u2013 such as eating too many fish from the top of the food chain. Even when excessive levels of Mercury are found in a patient, they will NOT advocate Detox to clear the poisonous metal from the person&#8217;s body.]</p>\n<p>106. &#8220;Dr. Issels innovated the surgical removal of focal infections of the jaw and Waldeyer&#8217;s tonsillar ring for rapid improvement in the immune status of many patients.

[I was finally able to ascertain the constituency of Coley&#8217;s Toxins. It is actually a vaccine comprising dead bacteria of the species Streptococcus Pyogenes and Serratia Marcescens. Thus it is an immunotherapy that activates macrophages, induces fever and triggers production of TNF and Interleukin-12. Once increased in number and switched to &#8220;defensive mode&#8221;, the macrophages are better able to recognise and destroy malignant cells, as well as bacteria; and one must appreciate that bacteria do loom large in the cancer equation. Furthermore, dead bacteria are not known for causing severe anaphylactic reactions. Allowing for an upper limit in tolerable fever temperature, such a vaccine should not have presented the kinds of lethal dangers that mainstream vaccines do. William Coley developed the treatment back the late 19th Century. It was in fairly common use in the US from 1893 until 1963, when the FDA assigned &#8220;New Drug Status&#8221; to it and thus made it illegal to prescribe except in clinical trials. It is curious, though hardly surprising to find the FDA so arbitrarily designating a therapy as a \u201cNew Drug\u201d that had been in common use for 70 years. In truth, it is a common contrivance on the FDA\u2019s part and in direct breach of a law that specifically exempts any drugs in common use before 1906 from \u201cNew Drug Status\u201d. Since then, some small clinical trials were sporadically conducted, but results were supposedly mixed. I think there has hardly been a single year pass since 1930 that the FDA hasn&#8217;t pulled at least one filthy stunt in its serial betrayal of the American public and citizens of those countries whose governmental regulatory agencies show a tendency to follow in its footsteps. Britain and Australia are among these countries. The FDA is still doing it, too.]</p>\n<p>108. &#8220;It never was. The National Institute of Dental Research \u2013 part of the National Institutes of Health \u2013 found out about my project and forced the university to have me stopped. I had a choice of returning to Brazil or changing my topic. I had no choice, but I still have the materials.&#8221; Dr. Pinto. [It is unclear whether this quote refers to research on Mercury-Silver dental fillings, or pathogenic organisms in extracted teeth (especially in root canals); and in either or both cases, the resulting disease incidences. It may relate to both, given parallel work by Dr. Issels.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5741\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5741\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5741\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 1:06 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5741#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5741\", \"5741\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>109. &#8220;In point of fact, fluoride causes more human cancer deaths, and causes it faster, than any other chemical.&#8221; Dean Burke, Former Chief Chemist Emeritus, US National Cancer Institute. [I have not verified the substance of this claim, which is to say that I have not confirmed the existence of irrefutable science proving the carcinogenicity of fluoride. However, fluoride is NOT friendly to the human biology in most forms and on balance of probability, Dean Burke should be regarded as being correct. What is interesting is that this was a senior NCI scientist. NCI is not renowned for permitting its senior staff to make comments like this one, so it must have been made after he left the NCI.] </p>\n<p>110. &#8220;It&#8217;s a toxic waste product of many types of industry; for instance, glass production, phosphate fertilizer production and many others. They would have no way to dispose of the tons of fluoride waste they produce unless they could find some use for it, so they made up this story about it being good for dental health. Then they can pass it through everyone&#8217;s bodies and into the sewer.&#8221; [A novel approach to toxic waste disposal&#8211;just feed it to the people and let their bodies &#8220;detoxify&#8221; it]. &#8220;It is a well coordinated effort, to keep it from being declared for what it is&#8211;a toxic waste.&#8221; Dr. Lee. [Fluoridation allegedly inhibits demineralisation of the tooth enamel caused by acids that sugar eating bacteria like Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacillus produce. This supposedly allows remineralisation to balance out the rate of demineralisation and the reduced incidence of tooth decay was first noted in regions where the water contained natural fluoride. The most common forms used are Sodium Fluoride, Fluorosilicic Acid (a byproduct of phosphate fertiliser manufacture) and Sodium Fluorosilicate. One of the most serious problems of water fluoridation is that the dose cannot be controlled. For that reason, domestic water supplies ought to contain NO dietary, nutritional or other chemical supplements. If you&#8217;re not using bottled water or a fluoride filter, you are at risk to a host of possible health problems, including cancer. Sodium Hypochlorite is also added to Australian water supplies and this spontaneously produces chloroform \u2013 a known carcinogen. The latter two fluoride forms can increase human uptake of Lead. A so-called statistical analysis in 2006 may have glossed these over, reporting no support for concerns of higher blood lead in children. When one considers what is given to our children for their own good (deadly and leukaemia causing vaccines and deadly chemo drugs for children who already have leukaemia for example) I would not put much stock in statements like that. Fluoride poisoning among whole populations has been known to occur (including at least one death) from accidental overfluoridation of the water supply. Three such outbreaks were reported in the US between 1991 and 1998. Long-term effects of too much fluoride include skeletal fluorosis and weakened bones. I even find water fluoridation difficult to accept on the premise that it keeps the pipes clear of algae. But the major official excuse is not algal control, but so-called dental health benefit. You get healthy teeth, but never mind the cancer, bone fluorosis and other health issues. They&#8217;re merely incidental and not a problem, because the authorities say they&#8217;re not &#8211; or &#8220;are within acceptable limits. Curiously, there is no clear legislation in Australia concerning domestic water treatment &#8211; only what are called &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5742\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5742\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5742\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 1:08 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5742#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5742\", \"5742\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>111. &#8220;I had a brain cancer specialist sit in my living room and tell me that he would never take radiation if he had a brain tumor. And I asked him, &#8216;but, do you send people for radiation?&#8217; and he said, &#8216;Of course. I&#8217;d be drummed out of the hospital if I didn&#8217;t.&#8217; &#8221; Dr. Ralph Moss, PhD.</p>\n<p>112. &#8220;The field of U.S. cancer care is organized around a medical monopoly that ensures a continuous flow of money to the pharmaceutical companies, medical technology firms, research institutes, and government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and quasi-public organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS).&#8221; John Diamond, M.D., &amp; Lee Cowden, M.D.</p>\n<p>113. &#8220;The Imperial Cancer Research Fund writes\u2014\u2018One of the biggest myths in recent years is that there is a cancer epidemic by exposure to radiation, pollution, pesticides and food additives. The truth is that these factors have very little to do with the majority of cancers in this country. In fact food additives may have a protective effect&#8212;particularly against stomach cancer.\u2019 Decades ago they (cancer charities) were relatively independent from industry&#8230; Now they are all but departments of large pharmaceutical companies. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) is a case in point. While most lay people imagine that it is simply a worthy charity collecting money to research cancer, few will understand that it is itself a multi-million-pound corporation which hardly makes a move independently of professional science, or its industrial pharmaceutical patrons and backers. Through its council and its benefactors, the ICRF is run by, and mainly for, the profit of the pharmaceutical companies: the very corporations whose products would have to be investigated for any wide-ranging investigation of cancer and the environment.&#8221; Martin Walker writing in the Ecologist vol 28 No 2. Martin Walker is the author of \u201cDirty Medicine.\u201d (ICRF <a href=\"http://www.icnet.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.icnet.uk/</a> ) [You don\u2019t need to know a huge amount about biology to easily recognise the ICRF\u2019s statement as a bald-faced lie. Radiation, pollution, pesticides AND food additives are doing enormous harm wholesale to people all over the world \u2013 the cancer epidemic is just the tip of the iceberg. The real myth is that ICRF serves the health interests of the British public, because in fact, it doesn\u2019t, any more than does the FDA or the EFSA, or the TGA. Dirty medicine is the true stock in trade of these organisations.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5743\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5743\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5743\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 1:10 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5743#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5743\", \"5743\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>114. &#8220;Two alleged trials took place under the direction of Dr. Charles Moertel at the Mayo Clinic. However as one might expect from a proven swindler operating at such a dishonoured location, these bore little resemblance to scientific methodology. Moertel cooked the first trial\u2026by packing the trial with patients whose immune systems had already been destroyed by toxic chemotherapy. He then rigged the second trial by treating the patients with ascorbate for only two and a half months and then continuing with the &#8220;trial&#8221; for another 2 years. He then issued a perjured press statement in which he announced that vitamin C therapy had been proven ineffective, carefully concealing the fact that he had almost certainly caused the death of several patients by reason of this iniquitous fraud. The resulting carefully devised publicity on the subject also caused the deaths of several other patients who had been happily surviving on ascorbate.&#8221; Dr. Richards &amp; Frank Hourigan. [It is not Moertel\u2019s only sequence of indiscretions. He has been guilty of much more. He died of cancer in June, 1994. Poetic justice.]</p>\n<p>115. &#8220;This man (Moertel) of the Mayo Clinic, no less\u2026had the effrontery to defend the employment of two toxic preparations, with no curative value, in cases of metastasised intestinal cancer lest they (the patients) otherwise seek it (hope) from the hands of quacks and charlatans. In other words Moertel urged the use of a harmful substance of no value\u2026on patients who are, presumably, paying a fee for their therapy,\u2026and are hoping for a cure,\u2026just to keep some other therapist from trying to save them!\u2026(You) can find a permanent record of the distinguished Dr. Moertel\u2019s recommendations in the New England Journal of Medicine, 1978.&#8221; Dr. Richards &amp; Frank Hourigan.</p>\n<p>116. &#8220;Vaccinations and sulfa drugs have been recognised as being directly responsible for the production of leukemia in humans.&#8221; Dr. B. Duperrat, of the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris, writing in the French medical journal Presse Medicale, March 12 1955. [This was certainly the case with Smallpox vaccinations \u2013 they DID cause Leukaemia in a lot of children, especially. It quite possibly applies to a plethora of others. There can be no doubt that orthodox vaccines DO kill and DO cause other serious diseases. The Gardasil Vaccine, with the deaths of 90 young Americans to its discredit as of February 2011 after only 4 \u00bd years in the market \u2013 is a glaring case in point.]</p>\n<p>117. &#8220;Already published reports, as well as our own observations indicate that smallpox vaccination sometimes produces manifestations of leukemia. In children and adults observed in the clinics of Cracow, smallpox vaccination has been followed by violent local and general reactions and by leukemia.&#8221; Professors Julian Aleksandrowickz and Boguslave Halileokowski of the Medical Academy of Cracow, Poland wrote as reported in Lancet, May 6 1967.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5744\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5744\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5744\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 1:14 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5744#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5744\", \"5744\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>118. &#8220;The vaccine modifies the terrain of the vaccinated, driving it towards alkaline and oxidised terrain &#8211; the terrain of cancer. The fact can no longer be denied.&#8221; The January 1958 issue of another French medical journal, Revue De Pathologie Generale et de Physiologie Clinique. [Author&#8217;s note: This quote surfaces the conflict of views regarding alkaline-versus-acidic terrain in the body and its relationship with cancer causality. Even as of January 2010, I have not been able to conclusively resolve this conflict, although weight of evidence strongly suggests an acidic environment with pH of 6.7 or lower is more conducive to cancer incidence, while an alkaline environment with pH of 7.1 to 7.5 is conducive to prevention and probable cure. Which particular vaccine is referred to here is not specified. Nevertheless, pH notwithstanding, vaccines are themselves much too typically troublesome and they DO modify the terrain in highly undesirable and often lethally dangerous ways.]</p>\n<p>119. &#8220;Up to 10% of childhood cancers are caused by radiological examination during pregnancy.&#8221; Prof. R. Doll, Nature, Vol. 265, 1977, page 589. [High energy radiation does in fact modify DNA. It\u2019s mutagenic. In an adult, exposure to X-Rays affects a given amount of stem cells, from which a malignant condition is more likely to spring than from matured cells. In the unborn child, there is a far greater proportion of these stem cells, which are providing the child&#8217;s growth and development. As the affected cells multiply in number during the child&#8217;s growth and pass on their mutation, so does the probability of carcinogenesis increase with their growing number; and therefore higher proportion of the total cell population. The unborn child is DEFINITELY at vastly greater risk under X-Rays than any adult. I predict most emphatically that if a study were to be conducted under careful and correct management upon the effects of X-Rays on foetuses, children and adults, a direct correlation would be solidly established between the proportionality of active stem cells in the people studied and the incidence of cancer \u2013 particularly leukaemia. What I mean is that the younger the person is, the more vulnerable to X-Ray effects they will be in direct relationship to their stem cell activity and rates of growth. How many childhood cancers like leukaemias are caused by X-ray exposure? I would say MILLIONS.] If you are a pregnant woman \u2013 NEVER tolerate X-Rays!</p>\n<p>120. &#8220;&#8230;Patients are as well, or better off untreated. My studies have proven conclusively that untreated cancer victims actually live up to four times longer than treated individuals. If one has cancer and opts to do nothing at all, he will live longer and feel better. With every patient that boosts his health to build up his natural resistance, there&#8217;s a high chance that the body will find its own defense against the cancer.&#8221; Hardin Jones, Professor of Medical Physics and Physiology, University of California, Speaking in 1975, quoted in the Journal of the American Anti-Vivisection Society. [Professor Jones&#8217;s assessment has never been refuted. The statement was also reported by Walter Last in The Ecologist, Vol 28, No. 2, March-April 1998, Page 120. What is more, according to Walter Last, three studies by other researchers have upheld his theory. It is a fact that a lot of people who have had cancer growing and spreading within them nevertheless manage to live fairly normal lives until the effects of malignancy prompt them to seek diagnosis of the problem. When cancer is diagnosed, the first thing that manifests is a psychological impact and that has a certain debilitating effect of its own, so it represents the imposition of an increased gradient upon the rate of the person&#8217;s deterioration in health. However, it is when they commence with an orthodox treatment that the deterioration hits a REALLY steep gradient, most particularly when it is a chemotherapy or radiotherapy that immediately puts the Immune System under the hammer. That is when they suddenly get VERY sick \u2013 much more seriously so than could ever be attributed to the malignancy itself. In countless such cases, fatality results in just a few months following the chemo treatment and medicos and scientists like Professor Jones who claim that those same people would have continued living for much longer without the treatment are more often than not completely correct.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5746\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5746\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/143055f9c02c19a5108fb3aca12fdf31?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">KNOWLEDGE</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5746\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 11, 2013 at 6:03 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5746#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5746\", \"5746\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to KNOWLEDGE'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Mad Prof, you know so much.

These are mainly preventive measures of course and essentially non-medical, so they&#8217;re easily put into effect.<br />\nBy MMS, I take it you mean MSM. This is useful by the oral or IV route, but I prefer its reduced form &#8211; DMSO, or both together. It can then be used transdermally, infused intravenously at 5% (a medical procedure) or taken orally if you can stand the awful taste. Bear in mind that DMSO and MSM are oxidative agents, so as is the case with Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide or Chlorine Dioxide, a slow dosage buildup protocol must be observed to ensure adequate regulation of oxygen radicals in the system. You touched upon a couple of aspects of the mind, body, heart and soul components with your items 9. &amp; 10. &#8211; these are important. If you add microbiome support, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal, the basic approach picture is rounded out quite well.<br />\nI could expand upon most of these and add some extra elements (I listed the &#8220;basics&#8221; in some earlier posts here) but to do so in any significant degree requires a foundation of biological theory at the appropriate levels &#8211; then one can build further on that. As such, I propose to post some info on cancer risk and causality factors, the progression of carcinogenesis, the biomechanisms and thence lead into the fundamental treatment principles, subsidiary principles and the &#8220;Phased Integrative Cancer Strategy&#8221; model.<br />\nIt&#8217;s a lot of material and could take weeks to post it all in this forum.<br />\nPerhaps you could do as I suggested to &#8220;Knowledge&#8221; &#8211; offer an email.

However, the problem here operates at a different level than that of immune overactivity &#8211; the hallmark of a classic autoimmune disease. Unfortunately, I can only generalise when it comes to treatment and it&#8217;s the same with ovarian cancer. Beyond the non-medical basics, I advocate a strong oxidative therapy, which could be Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, Chlorine Dioxide, DMSO, MSM or Intravenous Ascorbic Acid Megadosing &#8211; or a combination of these. All of these result in elevated levels of Hydrogen Peroxide &#8211; some of them doing it systemically &#8211; others more localised in tumours or individual malignant cells. As you may be aware, Hydrogen Peroxide is a major weapon produced and used by certain types of leucocyte to combat bacteria and malignant cells. It shifts the pH up the scale, renders the environment intolerable to anaerobic cells and organisms and induces apoptosis in most such entities that refuse to differentiate. DMSO, MSM and IV Ascorbic Acid provide for higher concentrations of H2O2 within malignant tissues, whereas O3, ClO2 and H2O2 are rather more exclusively systemic. With Leukaemia, it might be worth trying Cats Claw (Uncaria Tomentosa Chemotype I) and Astragalus Membranaceus, because they regulate immune activity. Clinoptilolite is an essential for all cancers, because it is a potent Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor and therefore operates at the G-phases in the Cell Cycle.  I have not yet positively identified a specific gene switch for Philadelphia Chromosome, but one or more peptides known as Burzinski&#8217;s Antineoplastons just might do the trick (some of these operate as gene switches) and they are generally anticarcinomic in any case. They&#8217;re safe and non-toxic with only minor side effects that are transient. Because DMSO is a potentiator in malignant tissues as well as a transdermal carrier, catalyst, antiviral, antifungal and even a potent analgesic, it is excellent in cancer treatment of any kind. It&#8217;s the cornerstone of what are called the Overnight Cancer Cure Protocols. These involve the buildup dosage patterns I have repeatedly mentioned and conditionally upon the protocol being correctly observed, adult dosages of 60 grams daily (5 gram increments hourly) are safely tolerable. Actually, 80 grams daily is safely tolerable in adults, but I don&#8217;t believe in getting too close to that limit. For either, but especially for ovarian cancer, I would additionally use Rife Technology. The best type of device is the Rife Beam Ray Machine or Rife-Bare Machine. These are Scalar Wave emission machine configurations that use the audio frequency settings, an RF carrier wave and plasma tube emitters. There are plenty of frequency settings for Leukaemias, but no specific frequency settings for ovarian cancers and as such, general cancer frequencies should be used:  2128, 2008, 2184, 2084, 2048, 2720, 2452, 6064, 120, 524, 854, 800, 728, 784, 880, 666, 464, 5000, 3176, 10000, 3040 and there are second and third frequency sets listed in Cancer&#8217;s Answers &#8211; Huge List of Rife Machine Frequencies. However, for Ovarian disorders, general &#8211; 650, 625, 600, 465, 444, 26, 2720, 2489, 2170, 2127, 2008, 1800, 1600, 1550, 802, 1500, 880, 832, 787, 776, 727, 690, 666, 20. These numbers are audio frequencies in Hertz. The carrier wave can be any frequency between 1 MHz and 30 MHz, with 3.1 MHz being excellent for deepest penetration into all tissues.<br />\nCancer&#8217;s Answers comes with a precision frequency generator in software form. You run it on your computer, so the computer becomes the basic Rife Machine. This signal is then audio-amplified to 150 &#8211; 200 Watts, mixed with the carrier frequency from an RF oscillator and the resulting signal is put through an impedance-matched coupling to a plasma tube or globe. The patient needs only be seated near the working machine for short periods of between 3 and 12 minutes, once only every three days. Medical monitoring is strongly advised. This is a potent procedure. Destruction of viruses and microorganisms is one of the main aims of using Rife Technology, because these are central to the cancer causality equation. Basically, viruses infect bacteria. Bacteria infect human hosts. Human tissue cells learn how to live independently of human systemic control mechanisms by inheriting recombinant viral DNA with such aberrant codons as immortalisation, drug-resistance, immune masking, G-phase fidelity cheats, aggressive anti-immunity (such as T-reg cells) and so on. Some agents are produced by the bacteria and much of the viral replication is also done by them &#8211; but ultimately, infusion of viral DNA into cell DNA (particularly into stem cells) is your major carcinogenic mechanism. Rife machines are devastatingly effective against viruses, bacteria and funghi &#8211; even resistant ones. They are also very good at re-energising the system and at boosting immunity. This is why they are so effective against cancers of all kinds.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5756\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5756\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5756\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 5:10 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5756#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5756\", \"5756\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Lovingterra, no problem!

[There is a staggering parallel between this and Christian Prophecy that the Messiah will return. That is because even if Jesus were to actually return, it would be acknowledged only by a very few and rejected by the majority under the influence of those who are already well entrenched in the hierarchy and who will oppose any threat to their power and prestige. Thus, it would lead to a schism in Christianity, like so many that have occurred previously. If a true magic bullet for cancer were to come, the same thing would happen and it would lead to a similar further fragmentation within the ranks of cancer medicine as has likewise occurred previously; and very much for the same reasons \u2013 power, prestige and MONEY. Now, since many such magic bullet therapies have in fact been discovered whereby they produce actual cures in excess of 90% of cases over a wide range of diseases including cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer&#8217;s, AIDS and Hepatitis to name a few, one must expect that such schisms have also occurred in medicine already. Then, if one closely examines the state of modern medical practice today, one finds that indeed, these schisms have indeed occurred many times.]</p>\n<p>122. &#8220;In England and Wales, total death rates from all forms of leukaemia have increased more than six times between 1920 and 1952&#8230; According to Wilkinson, sulphonamides (antibiotics) stand convicted as one of the contributing factors, even when fairly low dosages were employed.

When I retired I travelled and researched other therapies&#8230; I spoke with many doctors and patients who were getting excellent results from these alternative therapies and witnessed their success first hand. It is time to seriously question and reject the standard orthodox cancer treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, except in a very few instances.<br />\nYou may have difficulty in obtaining some of these therapies, because the FDA has literally pressured Congress, under the guise of protecting the public, to keep time-honoured cultural and natural therapies out of the hands of the general public.

Commenting about the state of America&#8217;s health system, &#8220;Well, the system&#8217;s broken&#8230;.&#8221;  United States President Barack Obama. [Footnote: President Obama followed up on his election mandate for health reform. His proposed legislation was rejected early in 2010 by a hostile Senate. By March 20th, he postponed his scheduled Australian visit to resolve the impasse and that visit was further delayed by the oil rig disaster in the Gulf Of Mexico; which in turn brought his national energy reform policies into priority focus. On health however, Australian medical system observers believe that even if his proposed overhauls were to be enacted successfully, they would not achieve a desirable result. Medical insurance premiums are employer-sourced, whilst unemployment is rising; so there&#8217;s a very serious inherent flaw right there; I am told there is no government-funded universal medical or base-level hospital care system in place; and insurance funds are profit-oriented, administratively top-heavy and inefficient. The entire system literally costs twice as much per capita to operate as Australia&#8217;s system, yet at the same time is of poorer quality overall. This does not mean that Australia&#8217;s medical system doesn&#8217;t need a solid kick in the backside, because it does. However, it is said that Mr. Obama&#8217;s model does not address America&#8217;s basic health problems and the faults in the American system run much deeper. They will ultimately require far more correction beyond even those basic measures, but there is every indication that there are too many parasites milking the system and they&#8217;re powerful, greedy ones with absolutely no scruples. They will not give an inch without a fight.]</p>\n<p>130. &#8220;An ethical oncologist must recognize the many shortcomings and failings of conventional therapy, however. Most everyone is aware of the negative side effects of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. They are immunodepressant and kill healthy cells as well as malignant cells. This can take a terrible toll on the patient&#8217;s quality of life and in some cases will actually shorten the patient&#8217;s life. But, there is an issue much more significant than the drawbacks of the side effects. Cancer cells become resistant to therapy over time. Unfortunately, many patients that experienced a good outcome at first with chemotherapy or radiation will find that they no longer respond as well on subsequent cycles. Conventional medicine can be part of the solution but it is limited and rarely extends the life of stage IV cancer patients for very long. This is why thousands of people seek out alternatives. Considering that less than 20% of people with stage IV breast cancer will survive longer than one year, it is understandable that many people want to see if there is a more promising approach.&#8221; Dr. Francisco Contreras, MD(H) &amp; Daniel E.

After three months of treatment with both orthodox and natural medicine, I was completely cancer-free, stunning doctors, family and friends. It is amazing what a totally open mind with the desire to heal can accomplish.

When this happens disease runs rampant, as we see with the immune destroyer known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. People don\u2019t die from AIDS; they die from diseases that their shot immune systems can\u2019t deal with. Ironically, vaccinations are supposed to boost the immune system when, in truth, they undermine it. All the crap they put into vaccines is another attack that the immune defence has to cope with and this reduces its ability to meet other challenges effectively by making the DNA/RNA misfire.  \u201cEven the process of making the vaccine includes using monkeys, chick embryos and surgically aborted human foetuses, along with disinfectants and stabilizers that include streptomycin, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, aluminium hydrochloride, sorbitol, hydrolyzed gelatin, formaldehyde and a mercury derivative called thimerosal\u2026.\u201d David Icke, author of \u201cInfinite Love Is The Only Truth \u2013 Everything Else Is Illusion\u201d. [This is a foreshortened version of the quote recorded in the previous Section A of this Chapter. David is correct where AIDS is concerned and in fact, the majority of AIDS sufferers actually die from cancer, or the evil therapies used to \u201ctreat\u201d it. When the Immune System is shot, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis I have described in the prior chapters of Cancer\u2019s Answers easily do the rest. The most effective treatments for AIDS and also viral Hepatitis are Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide. These agents usually cure. Currently, there is NO pharmaceutical drug that can cure AIDS and only recently has a drug been released that is alleged to cure viral Hepatitis. It is a recombinant DNA treatment. Addendum: A personal friend with Hepatitis C received this rDNA treatment on the recommendation of her specialist , who had designated all previous pharmaceutical Hep C treatments to be unsatisfactory and even dangerous. That was fair enough, so she took his word that this was the first and only safe and effective treatment. It wiped out some 95% of the virus as I understand it, but did not eradicate it. The downside is that it very nearly killed her. In time, the virus would have regenerated to its previous levels.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5765\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5765\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5765\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:01 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5765#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5765\", \"5765\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Here&#8217;s another one that sticks the truth straight back up the FDA&#8217;s fundamental orifice.</p>\n<p>133. \u201cWhen it comes to cancer breakthroughs, the mainstream, including some of the most prominent health organizations all over the world have a habit of botching studies, skewing results and hiding the truth about Nature&#8217;s cancer curing potential from the people who need it most.

In tier one: drug companies overstate a new drug&#8217;s benefits and downplay or even hide details about serious side effects. In tier two: doctors are given misleading information that they pass along to their patients.&#8221; Dr. Donald Light, PhD. [Donald Light is a professor of comparative health care at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, School of Osteopathic Medicine. He is an economic and organizational sociologist who compares health care systems and analyzes health care policies. He has written about the history and dynamics of health care markets and health care insurance, countervailing powers, the medical profession, immigrants and health care, and global justice. As a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics, Light is concerned about the high prices of medicines and barriers to their access. His research aims to provide a demythologised, more realistic account of costs, relative effectiveness and harms, and innovation than is promoted by commercial interests and sponsored academics. He is concerned that current incentives, laws, and regulations encourage companies to develop many new drugs with few advantages, rather than focusing on really superior new drugs. In the long run, this does not serve the major companies or society well. He has a website at www pharmamyths net.]</p>\n<p>138. In an analysis he presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Dr. Light ticked off three key reasons why the drug industry produces lemon after lemon:<br />\n\t&#8220;1) New drugs are tested by drug companies.<br />\n\t&#8220;2) Drug companies put up complex walls of legal protection to hide information about possible harm or lack of effectiveness.<br />\n\t&#8220;3) A new drug doesn&#8217;t actually need to be very effective to get FDA approval.&#8221; Dr. Donald Light, PhD. </p>\n<p>139. &#8220;A drug company&#8217;s principal responsibility is to its shareholders, not to the patient.&#8221; Dr. Max Pemberton, a columnist for The Telegraph.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5768\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5768\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5768\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:07 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5768#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5768\", \"5768\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>140. &#8220;A German epidemiologist from the Heidelberg/Mannheim Tumor Clinic, Dr. Ulrich Abel, has done a comprehensive review and analysis of every major study and clinical trial of chemotherapy ever done. His conclusions should be read by anyone who is about to embark on the Chemo Express. To make sure he had reviewed everything ever published on chemotherapy, Abel sent letters to over 350 medical centers around the world, asking them to send him anything they had published on the subject. Abel researched thousands of articles: it is unlikely that anyone in the world knows more about chemotherapy than he. The analysis took him several years, but the results are astounding: Abel found that the overall worldwide success rate of chemotherapy was &#8216;appalling&#8217; because there was simply no scientific evidence available anywhere that chemotherapy can &#8216;extend in any appreciable way the lives of patients suffering from the most common organic cancers&#8217;. Abel emphasizes that chemotherapy rarely can improve the quality of life. He describes chemotherapy administered throughout the world as a &#8216;scientific wasteland&#8217; and states that at least 80 per cent of chemotherapy administered throughout the world is worthless and is akin to the &#8217;emperor&#8217;s new clothes&#8217; \u2013 neither doctor nor patient is willing to give up on chemotherapy, even though there is no scientific evidence that it works!

I hold the department\u2019s highest medal of honor for bravery\u2014that used to mean a lot more to me than it does now. What I\u2019d like to talk to you about today is\u2014my now 7 year old daughter. This is an identical twin, her sister is now dead. Her sister, when she was 4 years old, Crystin\u2014developed a highly malignant brain tumor that had spread throughout her spine and her brain. The doctors told us that we had really two options\u2014take her home and let her die, or bring her in for massive dosages of chemo and radiation simultaneously. In either event she was going to die, they were quite certain of that\u2014and very quickly. Believing her only chance to be the standard route, we gave her the chemo and radiation. It burnt her skull so bad she had second degree burns and her hair never came back. To change her diapers we had to wear rubber gloves because her urine was so toxic and it burned her. At the end of 6 months, miraculously she survived the standard treatment, although there was a high expectation that she wouldn\u2019t. She still had cancer. We were told \u201csorry, we\u2019ve done everything we can, now she\u2019s going to die, probably within a couple of months.\u201d My wife and I choosing not to except that, started reading\u2014the first book I picked up, the third chapter, discussed Dr. Burzynski. As you may guess, I have some expertise in fraud, in fact I\u2019m quite certain there are enough attorneys in the room that I could be ordered as an expert in fraud\u2014and, I conducted my own investigation. I have no doubt the man is not a fraud. I have no doubt that he does what he does out of earnest belief that his medicine works. Now, you are in a position to judge for yourselves whether it works or not\u2014but it\u2019s well established by the FDA, that it\u2019s non-toxic. Eighteen months later, we took my daughter off the Antineoplaston\u2014she had not died. She had no signs of tumor, she remained free for eighteen months of cancer. Within a month, her cancer was wide-spread in her brain. We put her back on Burzynski\u2019s\u2014by the way at the objections of our doctors who for some reason felt that it had failed her. We put her back on\u2014within nine weeks the tumor was completely gone. She died last July, of neurological necrosis\u2014her brain fell apart from the radiation. The autopsy showed that she was completely cancer-free. Out of fifty-two cases of that disease ever, no one died cancer-free, just Cryssie. So she didn\u2019t die of a terminal illness\u2014she died of my inability to care for her properly and she died from bad advice. She died because there is a government institution, that disseminates false information, and is not looking out for the welfare of the people. You know, ladies and gentlemen I swore an oath eleven years ago and I think most of us in this room swore it at one time or another to uphold the constitution?

Dr. Burzynski had MRIs of brain tumors, known to be almost universally fatal, that had simply disappeared. It was obvious to me, that Dr. Burzynski had made the most important discovery in cancer treatment\u2014ever. It\u2019s what we have been looking for.\u201d Dr. Julian Whitaker, mid 1990s, Burzynski Movie interview.</p>\n<p>146. \u201cFrom where we started in the 1970\u2019s, is now forming a completely new approach to cancer treatment\u2014which is called &#8216;gene-targeted therapy&#8217;. Antineoplastons are medicines which work on the genes that are causing cancer, and now, there are 25 medications which belong to the family of gene-targeted therapy which are approved by the FDA in the United States. The problem with these medicines is that they don\u2019t cover as many genes as Antineoplastons, many of them simply work on single genes, and this is not enough to have long-term responses. A single medicine is not going to do it, it\u2019s not enough. Antineoplastons work on close to one hundred different genes.\u201d Dr. Stansilaw Burzynski, Burzynski Movie interview.</p>\n<p>147. On May 15th of 2000, I was diagnosed with an inoperable, stage three, anaplastic astrocytoma brain tumour. Following my diagnosis I was told that I had six to eighteen months to live. So I met with an oncologist here in Los Angeles and in San Francisco, and they were telling me at that time\u2014the oncologist told me, that the protocol for me would be to do Temodar\u00ae (On screen-graphics: Temodar for Anaplastic Astrocytoma = 13.9 month median survival) which is a chemotherapy, followed by a course of radiation. I asked them what that treatment would get me and they said maybe five years. &#8220;Maybe five years of life?&#8221; So of course I asked what would happen after five years, if I get to that five years and they said \u201cwell, we\u2019ll see what\u2019s available at that time\u201d meaning I would perpetually be on a course of treatment. Didn\u2019t sound good enough for me. Also at that time I had heard about Dr. Burzynski in Houston, and I found out about Dr. Burzynski through a friend of mine. But I met with a prominent neurosurgeon here [Dr. Keith Black of Cedars-Sinai]\u2014who wrote off Dr. Burzynski. He told me point blank that \u201cantineoplastons don\u2019t work\u201d. But Dr. Burzynski\u2019s treatment really sounded right to me. So I started on his treatment on June 6, of 2000. In December of 2000, all that was left of the tumour was scar tissue\u2014and again, this was confirmed through an MRI. On October of 2001, I stopped Antineoplaston therapy altogether. I\u2019ve had annual MRIs since that time, so over the course of the last eight years, annual MRIs have confirmed, all that\u2019s left of the tumour is scar tissue\u2014and I\u2019ve been off the treatment for that entire time. So, Dr. Burzynski cured me of a brain tumour.\u201d Jodi Fenton, Astrocytoma Survivor, Burzynski Movie interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5771\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5771\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5771\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:14 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5771#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5771\", \"5771\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>148. \u201cArguably, the worst type of cancer is inoperable brainstem glioma. It usually occurs in the brain of a child. And, unfortunately, there is very little that can be done. Radiation is the only \u201ctreatment\u201d available, which can be used to slow down the progress. So that\u2019s the type of tumour for which there is no curative treatment, no chemotherapy which has been approved, and numerous clinical trials were performed but failed in the past. So we selected this type of tumour, because we would like to prove the point beyond any doubt, that this type of cancer can be cured by the use of Antineoplastons\u2014and we already have proof that it can be cured.\u201d Dr. Stansilaw Burzynski, Burzynski Movie interview.</p>\n<p>149. \u201cFor a long time, I didn\u2019t have any contact with the Texas Board of Medical Examiners, until around 1984, some of my patients told me that they were approached by the agents sent to them by the Texas Board of Medical Examiners who were trying to convince them to file complaints against me. This was shocking to me. What is surprising is that they were using the state money, they were using taxpayer&#8217;s money to travel long distances, like from Houston to California, to convince our patients who live in California to file complaints against me. This was completely irrational. But nothing else happened at the time until I met, by coincidence, the Vice President of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Hickey, who informed me that I will have problems with the Texas Board of Medical Examiners. And obviously the problems began. I was called to the Texas Board of Medical Examiners, they began investigating me. However, there were no complaints from the patients, the patients were happy, we were treating patients who were very advanced, for whom there was no treatment available, and they were getting good results. So, apparently, there was no justification for such action. This was a very unpleasant investigation, they were trying to convince me again to stop my research and to stop treating patients. After about two years of going back-and-forth and being called to the board\u2014finally, they proposed to me that I should present to them a number of cases of patients who benefited from my practice. They informed me that such medical records would be reviewed by their expert oncologists and if they are satisfied that I am not harming patients and the patients are benefiting from my activity then they would leave me in peace. I was very happy with this, I believed that the Texas Board would do an objective review of our results and finally they would leave me alone\u2014because we had amazing results in the treatment of very difficult cancer cases. I supplied to them twice as many medical records, which showed without any doubt great results in the cancer treatment. Incurable forms of cancer completely disappearing, with patients going into complete remission and patients who were cured and living a normal life after that.\u201d In 1986, Dr. Burzynski agreed to present to the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners forty cases of various types of cancer he had successfully treated using Antineoplastons. Cancers in patients ranged from breast, bladder, lung, liver, brain, head and neck, to lymphoma. After submitting these cases to the medical board, he didn\u2019t hear back from them, leaving him to assume that the board was satisfied and would leave him in peace. [Source: 11/18/86 TMB Affidavit]. However, two years later, the board came back again, pretended that the cases he submitted were not successful, and claimed he was violating a law that didn\u2019t exist, which was grounds for the board to cancel, revoke, or suspend his license. [Source: 9/6/88 TMB Complaint] \u201cIt was a shock to me. I believed in justice, I believed in the high ethics of the board, but this was just a lie.\u201d Dr. Stansilaw Burzynski, Burzynski Movie interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5772\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5772\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5772\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:19 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5772#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5772\", \"5772\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>150. Subsequent to the developments of Quote #149, the Texas Medical Board, under pressure from the FDA, prosecuted Burzynski before a (County?) and then District Court; followed by Grand Jury trials at least four times \u2013 all without success, bar one in which a judge imposed an injunction against him. During one of these trials, a leading expert of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Nicholas Patronas, a board-certified radiologist since 1973, professor of radiology at Georgetown University, and founder of the neuroradiology section of the National Cancer Institute [Source: NIH Staff Pages] recognised the absurdity of the Texas Medical Board\u2019s case against Burzynski, put his own career on the line and flew himself to Texas to testify on Dr. Burzynski\u2019s behalf. Dr. Patronas testified under oath his role at the National Cancer Institute and gave testimony concerning his own observations about Burzynski\u2019s work with cancer patients. It included this remark. \u201cWell, it\u2019s amazing, the fact that they (Burzynski\u2019s patients) are not handicapped from the side effects of any treatment, and the side effects of most aggressive treatments are worse than the tumour itself, so these particular individuals not only survived, but they didn\u2019t have major side effects. So I think it\u2019s impressive and unbelievable.\u201d Dr. Nicholas Patronas, NCI, in trial testimony for Dr. Burzynski. [It does seem that not everybody employed in organisations such as the NCI has the stink of corruption. There may yet be hope!] </p>\n<p>151. &#8220;It is ironic but true that many cancer chemotherapies are known to cause cancers.&#8221; Dr. Otis Brawley, Chief Medical Officer, American Cancer Society. [I wanted to stop adding more quotes at 150, but this one was just too juicy to exclude. Dr. Brawley\u2019s admission refers to chemo drugs commonly used in this 21st Century \u2013 not just the archaic toxins predating 1970. In any case, most of those archaic poisons like the Nitrogen Mustards ARE still in common use and even some recently developed drugs actually belong to this class of chemical warfare poisons, too.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5773\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5773\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5773\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:19 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5773#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5773\", \"5773\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>152. In June, 2011, Richard Alderman, director of the SFO, addressed the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) and singled out the UK pharmaceutical industry, noting that it was \u201con the high risk register of the US Department of Justice\u201d (DoJ) and that it \u201cwill be receiving a considerable amount of attention from the DoJ.\u201d [The UK government has introduced new bribery laws, which will be prosecuted by the SFO (UK). This is likely to be a double standard situation in the US. The American pharmaceutical industry, on its own turf in America, is likely to continue enjoying a privileged position of immunity against the DoJ, since such things as facilitation payments made to the FDA have been perfectly legal to date and it is unlikely that any US government would legislate to terminate the huge half-billion-dollar revenue windfall it generates each year. Nevertheless, the signals sent by the British SFO and American DoJ clearly indicate prior knowledge or suspicion on the parts of these authorities of corrupt practices by British pharmaceuticals, if not those of other countries. The question remains then, \u201cAre these merely loud noises being made by paper tigers?\u201d Big money roars much louder than paper tigers and nowhere more so than in America. Putting another spin on this speculation, \u201cCan American pharmaceutical companies swing this government attention towards the ABPI in their own favour? Can they step into the breach to increase their market share if British pharmaceuticals get taken down a few notches?\u201d After all, they\u2019ve got the FDA in their pockets.]</p>\n<p>153. &#8220;An additional increased spike in incidence of autism occurred in 1995 when the chicken pox vaccine was grown in human foetal tissue.&#8221; Helen Ratajczak, a senior scientist of pharmaceutical corporation Boehringer-Ingelheim. [It has come to my attention that millions upon millions of vaccines \u2013 all of them nowadays \u2013  are produced from just three aborted foetuses, according to HSI\u2019s sources; or, according to Ratajczak, about 23 types of vaccine. Autism as a condition was first identified in 1943 and Ratajczak recently produced a 79-page review of autism research that spanned the whole period from 1943 to the present. It has important insights about the contents of vaccines and how they could trigger autism as the main focus of one particular article she published on the subject, but more broadly, her studies embraced other neurological disorders associated with vaccines. This quote is from that review. We already knew about Thimerosal (or Thiomersal, a toxic Mercury compound), autoimmune diseases, fatal anaphylaxia and contaminations by deadly toxins and microbes or viruses in vaccines. Now we\u2019ve got this \u2013 autism in children given the chickenpox vaccine. What next? And is it any surprise that pharmaceutical corporations, government regulating bodies and your medico do not inform people about what\u2019s in these vaccines and worse yet \u2013 actively oppose scientific investigations into the safety of using them?]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5774\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5774\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5774\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:23 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5774#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5774\", \"5774\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>154. Dr. Franklin \u2013 a former research fellow at Harvard Medical School \u2013 is the director of market research at Boston Scientific, a company that develops medical devices. Reflecting on his time at Warner-Lambert, a pharmaceutical company acquired by Pfizer circa 2000, he says the thing that was most troubling was the pressure they put on him to encourage doctors to prescribe Neurontin in much higher doses than it was approved for. He told the New York Times, \u201cI recognized that my actions may be putting people in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Dr. David P. Franklin; Sources: \u201cDrug Giant Accused of False Claims\u201d NBC Dateline, 7/11/03, msnbc.com \u201cSuit Says Company Promoted Drug in Exam Rooms\u201d The New York Times, 5/15/02, nytimes.com [This may have been the thing that troubled him most, but what emerged as evidence in Franklin\u2019s lawsuit during 1997 against Warner-Lambert was in fact a litany of illegal and dishonest marketing tactics involving this anti-seizure epileptic drug, to say nothing of a host of other drugs. It began with enlisting doctors like Franklin to encourage physicians to prescribe Neurontin for a wider range of off-label uses for which the drug was not approved, such as pain relief, bipolar disorder and ADHD in children. It extended to paying marketing consultants $12,000 each for bogus medical journal articles and doctors $1,000 each for agreeing to have their names listed as \u201cauthors\u201d of the articles. Salespeople then used them to promote off-label use as being \u201csafe and effective\u201d. Also, Warner-Lambert paid 75 to 100 physicians $350 or more per day for allowing sales representatives to sit in on doctor-patient consultations. It is unclear whether any of the patients knew these representatives were not doctors and that there may consequently have been breaches of privacy laws. At the conclusions of these exams, the sales representatives gave recommendations on what medications to prescribe. Can you believe that?? No, it doesn\u2019t end there. 75% of Warner-Lambert\u2019s $2 billion per year in Neurontin sales is for off-label use; and 37% of doctors who participated in a Maryland study said they had received compensation from drug companies for prescribing their drugs. There is little doubt Warner-Lambert was no different from any other pharmaceutical company in this regard \u2013 Pfizer\u2019s post-2000 denials subsequent to its buying-up of Warner-Lambert notwithstanding. One instance was recorded in which a doctor kept increasing the dose of Neurontin to a bipolar patient when standard dosage didn\u2019t work. After becoming hostile and attempting to commit suicide, she was taken off the medication. We have here a classic case in which sales representatives are directed by their pharmaceutical employers to do the drug prescribing by proxy. Thus the doctors are their pawns and fall guys; patients are their victims; and both patients and governments are the cash cows \u2013 even paying, in the ultimate analysis, for all the kickbacks, incentives and enormous Fortune 500 profit margins, as well as the pharmaceutical drugs themselves. There is more about Neurontin, because Parke-Davis, which was acquired by Warner-Lambert in 1970, apparently conducted a 1995 trial of this drug that was exclusively designed to make it more popular among doctors. This is known as a \u201cseeding trial\u201d. Some 770 doctors were recruited as \u201cstudy investigators\u201dand they in turn recruited 2,759 patients. Of those, over 1,000 experienced mild side effects, 70 experienced severe adverse events and 11 died. Subsequent to the trial, Neurontin sales increased by 40%.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5775\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5775\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5775\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:29 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5775#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5775\", \"5775\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>155.

It has since been used by over 100,000 terminal cancer patients, as well as early stage cancer patients, in numerous countries with varying, yet impressive, degrees of success, without one instance of any side effect. Furthermore, it may be used as a preventive and is inexpensive. 714X was made legal by prescription for Canadian citizens by the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare in 1989 after a three-year emotional court battle, which was won by Gaston Naessens. The story of this remarkable genius, his microscope, his phenomenal advancements in understanding the blood, his ability to pre diagnose cancer and degenerative disease up to two years prior to its manifestation, his discovery unlocking the secrets of cancer cell activity and its elimination and the attempts of the Canadian medical authorities to destroy him was first told by best-selling author Christopher Bird, in his book: THE GALILEO OF THE MICROSCOPE. Later, Bird&#8217;s book was retitled: THE PERSECUTION AND TRIAL OF GASTON NAESSENS.<br />\nIn order to comply with federal requirements and after considerable research and preparation, we compiled, published and marketed a book titled: DO NO HARM: Defying a Hopeless Prognosis: to introduce, inform, educate and obtain &#8220;Informed Consent,&#8221; from any prospective users of 714X.<br />\nWe began in 1990 by selling Bird&#8217;s book and offering regular radio interview presentations. Later, after much research, we became aware that the FDA was preventing various cancer remedies from the U.S. market since the 1920&#8217;s. This horrifying revelation spurred us to create the first citizen organized Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) under the laws of Congress and to do whatever was required to make the public aware.<br />\nFrom the inception of our IRB in April of 1992, the FDA paid regular visits to our office and requested and received copies of all available research, toxicology studies, spectrographic chemical evaluations, rat studies, patient histories, books, tapes and samples of the 714X. Later, they testified under oath in court that: &#8220;We have no knowledge nor understanding.&#8221;<br />\nEven though we cooperated with all requests, our office was raided by the FDA. Computers, books, tapes and business records were seized, as well as patient files, without the consent of our patients. After several attempts by the U.S. Attorney, a Grand Jury indicted me and my corporation as co-conspirators, with a felony charge under Title 18 U.S.C. 321, &#8220;Conspiring to Defraud the United States by importation of an unapproved new drug.&#8221; We later discovered through the Freedom of Information Act (&#8220;FOIA&#8221;) that the agency regulation had never undergone the requirements of the Federal Register Act and therefore was not promulgated. In other words, it&#8217;s NOT law only an agency regulation.\u201d Charles Pixley, National Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5776\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5776\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5776\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5776#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5776\", \"5776\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>157. \u201cThe FDA regularly approves dangerous, often lethal pharmaceuticals. The side effects of these potentially deadly, or harm causing pharmaceutical drugs can only be fully discovered by wide-spread use. This is despite the average $250-$500 million and 15 years to bring these drugs to market, including phase trial tests, trying to prove the elusive &#8220;efficacy&#8221; requirement of the F.D.&amp;C. Act.<br />\nTypically, after one of their highly publicized &#8220;wonder&#8221; drugs fails, causes death or serious side effects, no FDA official nor PAC member company president, research assistant, corporate official, company doctor, nor testing lab will be subjected to raid, investigation, indictment or jail term.<br />\nChemotherapy and radiation, though it is known for 33 years to be a total failure in the so-called war against cancer, remain as the only therapies which enjoy federal mandate. These therapies are repeatedly reintroduced as new, or new approaches, promising that sometime in the unknowable future, maybe we will have a cure for cancer. Yet the so-called alternative healing arts are consistently accused of offering false hope.\u201d Charles Pixley, National Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians.</p>\n<p>158. \u201cThe current and long-standing 3% long-term survival rate of cancer patients using orthodox therapies remains abysmal and the statistical reportage is obfuscated. Refer to : New England Journal of Medicine, &#8220;Progress Against Cancer,&#8221; May 8, 1986 by John C. Bailar, III and Elaine M. Smith, and a ten-year follow-up &#8220;The War on Cancer&#8221; which appeared in Lancet, May 18th, 1996, by Michael B. Spoorn.<br />\nIn HEALTH UNITED STATES, an annual publication by the federal government, our national death rate from cancer is approximately 2,500,000 people per year and the rate is rising. In addition to the trauma and suffering to the patients and their families and the productive work force, it comes with a hefty price tag.<br />\nAssuming a cost of $80,000 to $160,000 per person over the last 20 years, that figure represents $200,000,000 to $370,000,000 per year and 50,000,000 lives, or $4 TRILLION to $7.5 TRILLION dollars funneled from our collective economy into the hands of the medical pharmaceutical cartel. Is it any wonder, then, why we cannot find a cure?<br />\nIt is increasingly apparent that we have surrendered many of our fundamental Rights and have become subservient to a &#8220;legislative democracy&#8221; which usurps the legitimate sovereignty of the people and abrogates it to itself. The power structure designed by our founders as a Republican form of government, where the power descends from GOD to WE the People, from the people to the county, from the county to the state and from the state to Congress, not the other way around.<br />\nBy our tacit complacence, it has surreptitiously created the coast to coast &#8220;federal zone&#8221; where WE have become its federal citizens. Refer to: FAIR TRADE FRAUD, Freedom in Chains: The Rise of the State and the Demise of the Citizen, Shakedown: How the Government Screws You from A to Z, and, or Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty, by James Bovard for a shocking look at the rights we have surrendered.\u201d Charles Pixley, National Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5777\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5777\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5777\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:34 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5777#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5777\", \"5777\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>159. \u201cBoth Gaston Naessens and Dietmar Schildwaechter, Ph.D., MD, have spent the last 25 years perfecting independent blood tests, which are able to pre diagnose any type of cancer and immune disorders up to two years prior to their onset, with a 1% margin of error. The industrial average false/negative ratio remains extremely high by comparison, yet these new tests are ignored or met with resistance.<br />\nWith early detection and preventive therapy, like 714X and so many others that have been suppressed, cancer can be controlled or even eliminated. Finding a cure for your cancer may only be limited by your will. Taking control of your life, becoming informed of all the options world-wide, remaining calm in the face of the threat posed by disease and placing your trust in God may also be part of the answer. Be patient with yourself, you didn&#8217;t develop cancer overnight and you won&#8217;t eliminate it overnight either.<br />\nAssigned by the Almighty to jump headlong into the long-standing evil trade war between the dissimilar camps within the healing arts had its rewards and its price. Serving a sentence in federal prison hasn&#8217;t been one of the best experiences of my life, but it could have been much harder and I would do it all over again if necessary. However, in my view, the ones who are being punished are the people of all nations who are denied access to life-saving therapies.\u201d Charles Pixley, National Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians.</p>\n<p>160. \u201cHomeopathy is an honored and recognized healing art. It was originated in 1757 by Samuel Christian Hahnemann, MD, a German allopath who had grown weary of the failures of the &#8220;regular school&#8221; to eliminate disease. In America alone, from its founding and through the First World War, 65% of the American public enjoyed its gentle therapies, even though the art was practised by only 15% of the physicians. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;F.D.&amp;C. Act&#8221;) states that any substance included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States,(&#8220;HPUS&#8221;), the United States Pharmacopoeia, (&#8220;USP&#8221;) or the NATIONAL FORMULARY, (&#8220;NF&#8221;) prior to 1906 is approved as safe and effective requiring no further approval.<br />\nHarris L. Coulter, Ph.D., of Washington, DC, and editor of the 8th edition of the HPUS, testified before the United States District Court that all components of 714X as compounded by Gaston Naessens are indeed in the HPUS prior to 1906 and therefore NOT a new drug as the FDA charged.  Dr. Coulter is an internationally renowned medical historian and author of over 30 books and essays, which include: THE DIVIDED LEGACY, a four volume epochal history of medicine, which covers its origins to present day.\u201d Charles Pixley, National Director, Association of Eclectic Physicians.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5778\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5778\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5778\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 6:38 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5778#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5778\", \"5778\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>162. \u201cThe case against me and the destruction of our business for making available a promising &#8220;cure&#8221; for cancer is only one of dozens by the FDA, or &#8220;Big Medicine,&#8221; since the early 1900&#8217;s. One of the first targeted in this country was Dr. Royal Raymond Rife. His powerful evolutionary microscope, capable of shattering cancer cells and viruses with radio frequency vibrations, was destroyed and his books burned by federal authorities and he was imprisoned.<br />\nAndrew Ivy, MD, a pillar of the A.M.A., who came back from Germany after participating as a panelist in the Nuremberg war crime trials with a cure for cancer called Krebiozen, had his career shattered. Some other embattled pioneers include, but are certainly not limited to: The healing arts of Ethnobotany, Naturopathy Chiropractic and Acupuncture and Chelation, which all met intense resistance and violent opposition by federally protected orthodoxy.<br />\nOur own IRB Chief Investigator, Dietmar Schildwaechter, Ph.D., MD, was invaded in his home office in a militant style by state and federal authorities in the late 1980&#8217;s for introducing a cure for Squamous cell cancer, which was proven in a 20-year study in Germany. Bruce Halstead, MD Warren Levin, MD;Vincent Speckhart, MD; Royal Raymond Rife, MD<br />\nWilhelm Reich, MD; Jossef Issels, MD; and Max Gerson, MD;<br />\nJoseph Gold, MD, Emmanuel Revici, MD; Stanislaw Burzynski, MD;<br />\nJames Privitera, MD; Ed McCabe, author of Oxygen Therapies, jailed for 547 days; and very recently best selling author and cancer therapist, Hulda Clark, ND;  and too many more not listed here.<br />\nThese gifted pioneers brought relief to a suffering humanity and were ruthlessly attacked by medical authorities and scientific dogma. Each paid a high price but distinguished themselves by their courage and resolve to stand up for their convictions, even in the face of overwhelming opposition, loss of license and jail.

The jury of four housewives, two saleswomen, a stenographer, a printer, a retired machinist, a maintenance man, a truck driver and a janitor heard more than 4,000,000 words of testimony so full of conflicting claims that Judge Julius J. Hoffman declared: \u2018This case bristles with issues of veracity.\u2019 &#8221; Julius J. Hoffman, Presiding Judge of the Durovic &amp; Ivy trial, to TIME Magazine.</p>\n<p>164. \u201cLast week, despite the mountains of evidence amassed by the prosecution, the jury decided every last one of those issues in the defendants&#8217; favor and acquitted them on all counts. It was clearly the question of Krebiozen&#8217;s medicinal value that had been on the jurymen&#8217;s minds. Explained Foreman Adolph J. Beranek: \u2018There had been no fair test of Krebiozen. We were convinced that it had some merit, and we were not in a position to kill it without a fair trial.\u2019 &#8221; Adolph J. Beranek, Foreman Juror of the Durovic &amp; Ivy trial to TIME Magazine.</p>\n<p>165. \u201cThe bottom line is that radionics devices have no value for diagnosing or treating anything.\u201d Dr. Stephen Barrett, MD, Principal of the Quackwatch website. [I simply could not resist adding this declaration by Barrett, taken from an article he wrote by way of reviewing electromedical devices \u201cfor public information\u201d. Apart from being utterly false, it may seem an unremarkable statement, until you see the next quote #166!]</p>\n<p>166. \u201cDuring the past few years, magnetic devices have been claimed to relieve pain and to have therapeutic value against a large number of diseases and conditions. The way to evaluate such claims is to ask whether scientific studies have been published. Pulsed electromagnetic fields \u2013 which induce measurable electric fields \u2013 have been demonstrated effective for treating slow healing [bone] fractures and have shown promise for a few other conditions. However, few studies have been published on the effect on pain of small, static magnets marketed to consumers.\u201d Dr. Stephen Barrett MD, Principal of the Quackwatch website, excerpted from his website as revised April 26, 2001 as part of a website review by Dr. Joel Kauffman and reproduced in Cancer\u2019s Answers Chapter Eight &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/reviews/reviews_16_2_kauffman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/reviews/reviews_16_2_kauffman.pdf</a>. [This particular passage comes from a Barrett article in which his focus was on disparaging the therapeutic use of static field permanent magnets and it appears that at the time, he wasn\u2019t too particularly concerned about what he let slip about PEMFT radionics or TENS pulsed electric devices \u2013 because he ADMITS their efficacy in a limited range of applications \u2013 that is, after stating flatly that radionics devices have no value for diagnosing or treating anything. Three things of significance arise here. Firstly, there is the obviously direct conflict with his statement quoted in #165 \u2013 got him dead to rights, with his \u201cideological integrity pants\u201d down around his ankles. Say, \u201cCheese!!!\u201d Secondly, it&#8217;s a fact that electromedical devices such as Rife Machines have the broadest utility and greatest efficacy of all kinds of medical treatment \u2013 barring absolutely none \u2013 and that includes total cure in a huge range of diseases and afflictions not matched by anything alse whatsoever. Thirdly, he stated that few studies have been published on the effects of static field magnets, yet several have been, both for the better and worse \u2013 yet again, as I have noted elsewhere in Cancer\u2019s Answers and particularly in the Kauffman review, his selection of citations was heavily skewed against any revelation of favourable regard for the magnets (or other Alternative treatment modalities, for that matter); and those cited studies showing no efficacy appear to be fudged, misreported, non-existent or otherwise demonstrably unreliable. That is especially so of the bogus \u201cDanish Study\u201d, a favourite of the medical establishment and of Barrett in particular, but which was criticised heavily by reviewing peers \u2013 yet Barrett cited it, anyway. It was never going to be difficult to nail the bugger for being a liar, once I set out to find the proof; and moreover, it was never going to be difficult to locate proven science to show that what Barrett claims to be science is nothing of the kind. Barrett is only partly correct in one thing this excerpted statement quotes from him: \u201cThe way to evaluate such claims is to ask whether scientific studies have been published.\u201d It is only partly correct, because it is not enough to ask whether they\u2019ve been published \u2013 they must be examined for satisfactory design, methodology and veracity. A secondary question, \u201cWhat entities actually designed, conducted and/or evaluated the scientific studies and what motives are indicated for their doing so?\u201d must also be asked, because it would astound you to learn just how many such studies are absolutely controlled from start to finish by entities with vested commercial interest or some similarly crooked ulterior motive; and they have shamelessly ABUSED the privilege, time and time again. Barrett relies heavily on the presumption that you won\u2019t check those things for yourself; and what Barrett calls scientific studies are generally very different things from what YOU should call scientific studies. They frequently refer to material at his own Quackwatch site including drivel authored by himself; or to fudged studies sponsored by NCI and carried out by MSK and Mayo. These are three organisations among several that are widely implicated in breaches of public trust and which one shouldn\u2019t trust as far as one can toss a rogue bull elephant. If that makes no sense, think of it this way\u2026 You can\u2019t toss a rogue elephant. He\u2019ll toss you instead, with fatal consequences; which is to say that if you trust NCI, MSK or Mayo on matters of your cancer treatment, you\u2019ll get tossed into the grave.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5781\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5781\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5781\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:06 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5781#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5781\", \"5781\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>168. \u201cCancer is trophoblast in spatial and temporal anomaly, hybridized with, and vascularized by, hostal or somatic cells and in irreversible and fiercely malignant antithesis to such&#8221; (Dr. Ernst T. Krebs Jr. \u2013 Townsend Letter for Doctors, Feb.-March, 1993, p. 175). [The Trophoblast Theory Of Carcinogenesis was first put forward in 1902 by Scottish embryologist John Beard. He noted that in almost every way, the Trophoblasts that encapsulate and protect an embryo behave just like cancer cells, in that they are aggressive, invasive, multiply rapidly, resist immune system attack and indeed, create immunosuppressants to switch off the Immune System\u2019s recognition and defence mechanisms. One of the central agents common to both is hCG (or its bacterial equivalent, bCG). This Trophoblastic outlook has been endorsed by many distinguished cancer specialists throughout the last 100 years right up till the present. They included Ernst T. Krebs Jr. (Laetrile\u2019s discoverer), Dr. Valentin Govallo (IPT) and Dr. M. Rigdon Lentz (Ultrapheresis Machine). Various among these specialists have improved upon the theory and integrated it with other elements including the Pleomorphic Microbe Theory of Doctors Rife, Warburg and Livingston-Wheeler genesis. Trophoblastic Theory never acquired universal favour in the medical mainstream and fell into deeper obscurity around the time of Laetrile\u2019s rise in popularity. Laetrile&#8217;s rise was not the cause \u2013 actually the theory\u2019s obscuration was brought about by competing interests, because Radiotherapy was also coincidentally on the rise and driven by big dollars at that time.]</p>\n<p>169. \u201cPregnancy and cancer are the only two biologic conditions in which antigenic tissue is tolerated by a seemingly intact immune system. It is recognized that trophoblastic tissue has all the characteristics of a true cancer; it is deeply invasive, it is highly anaplastic in morphology [i.e., lacks normal shape], it has a high mitotic index [i.e., frequently divides], and it produces oncofoetal antigens [i.e., shows `Baby On Board&#8217;]&#8230;in every respect, [it] behaves as a true cancer.&#8221; Dr. M.

In one call McQueen made to me, he stated in his famous hero\u2019s voice, &#8220;I\u2019m going to blow the lid off this Cancer Racket.&#8221; This of course freaked out the Cancer Establishment. The FBI then leaked it out to the National Enquirer scandal sheet of the CIA. This exposure was to discredit me. McQueen was then constantly watched and harassed by the FBI, CIA and the Media. During the surgery, the skin over the liver was cut open and the encapsulated, dead Tumor fell out on the operating table. After surgery McQueen had a talk with me.

If essential oils are used arbitrarily and applied in  excess, it is possible that some may burn or sting or cause allergic reactions, and some might actually be harmful. If, however, we use essential oils responsibly and with common sense, the risks are minimal. Proper dosage is as critical for plant-derived medications and essential oils as for any other drugs. Any form of medication, whether a conventional drug or essential oil, that has positive effects when administered in a therapeutic dosage can cause severe problems if overdosed. Nevertheless, the risks associated with plant medicines have been exaggerated by the pharmaceutical lobby, as statistics show. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, 809 cases of fatal poisonings and 6,407 cases of serious but nonfatal poisonings were reported caused by conventional pharmaceuticals between 1988 and 1989. In contrast, plant-based preparations caused 2 fatalities and 53 serious poisonings in the same time period. The most dangerous plants were not medicinal but were house plants or shrubs.\u201d allaboutaromatherapy com. [At first, I thought this was a quote from Dr. Jean Valnet, but I could not corroborate that. Neither could I identify the website\u2019s principal. The 809 fatalities quoted here as sourced from the AAPCC are much lower than the 160,000 annual deaths attributed to the \u201cproper and correct use of pharmaceutical drugs, as cited in other literature. When looking at the sheer magnitude of this discrepancy, one can&#8217;t help but ask, \u201cWell, who&#8217;s telling the truth?\u201d The  much larger number of 160,000 deaths each year would at first appear to be heavily exaggerated and therefore the likely culprit. However, whilst I have so far been unable to verify this figure for accuracy, it is because I have not yet attempted to get past the smokescreens of concealment and dig deeper for the real truth. I still have have other priorities. Countless other instances exist where I&#8217;ve in fact verified the veracity and accuracy of claims made on behalf of Alternative Medicine campaigners, doctors and so on and I must tell you that in not one single case whatsoever have I verified any such claim to be false. Every single case of a claim being verified false has been one where the claim in question was made on behalf of Orthodox Medicine campaigners, doctors and so on. Again, in the absence of conclusive proof, if one must draw inferences on the basis of probability and motive, one MUST favour the progenitors of Alternative Medicine. The figure of 160,000 deaths is far more likely to be an approximation of the true scale of the problem \u2013 not that quoted from the AAPCC. Of course, that in turn infers that the AAPCC is lying about those numbers.]</p>\n<p>172. &#8220;It is conceivable that the day will come when the true therapeutic value of natural substances will be given proper recognition.&#8221; Dr. Jean Valnet MD, Aromatherapist 1920-1995. [Today, modern science has validated the worth of essential oils in thousands of medical studies. Nevertheless, the battle for assumption of their rightful roles in medicine continues. Valnet had an impressive list of credentials.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5784\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5784\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5784\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:15 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5784#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5784\", \"5784\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>173. (Interviewer asking Alf Riggs about knowledge of Schumann Waves): \u201cSo it still hasn\u2019t filtered out to the universities?\u201d \u201cNo; and this is an extremely important and beneficial type of radiation. When I delivered my paper I started talking about the benefits of Schumann Waves, it upset one or two people. There was a professor there who delivered a paper on the biological effects of AC fields in the area of the brain in as far as it reduced the production of melatonin. Well, I would fully agree with that, based on my observations, but when I said there wouldn\u2019t be any melatonin without the beneficial Schumann waves, he couldn\u2019t come to terms with that at all. In fact he was shouting at me across the table at lunch in the university and there was a Danish physicist who wanted to ask me some questions and he wouldn\u2019t allow it. He kept getting up and putting his hand in front of his mouth. There\u2019s something radically wrong with that bloke. There\u2019s quite a few of those around.\u201d Alf Riggs interviewed in 1999. [Schumann Waves have aroused my interest and I have commenced to research them. As for the inexcusable conduct of the other professor, Alf is correct. There\u2019s quite a few of those in Academia and there\u2019s something radically wrong with them. Of course, they also abound in Medicine and there\u2019s something radically wrong with Medicine. OK, now Schumann Resonances as they are more accurately named were first discovered (vaguely) by the genius Dr. Nikola Tesla at his Colorado Springs laboratory circa 1899. There he determined that Earth\u2019s electromagnetic resonance was about 8 Hz and scientists later refined that to 7.83 Hz \u2013 something I already knew, but without realising it is actually the Schumann Resonance base frequency, the lowest of several ELF spectrum peaks propagating in the atmospheric cavity between the Earth\u2019s surface and the Ionosphere. They are excited by lightning and now that I think of it, they possibly also couple with what radio operators call \u201cground waves\u201d and \u201cskip\u201d. The other resonances are 14.3 Hz, 20.8 Hz, 27.3 Hz, 33.8 Hz, 40.3 Hz, 46.8 Hz, 53.3 Hz and 59.9 Hz. After Tesla, Heaviside and Kennelly suggested the existence of the Ionosphere and its capability of trapping these electromagnetic waves in 1902. This is the very same Oliver Heaviside who co-derived the four Heaviside-Gibbs or Heaviside-Hertz (vector derivation) Equations from James Clerk  Maxwell\u2019s elusive Quaternionic Equations, now said to number 20 instead of 16. Heaviside is quoted as saying, \u201cThey [Maxwell\u2019s original equations] had to be murdered.\u201d The Heaviside-Gibbs/Hertz Equations are now known as Maxwell\u2019s Equations and those original Quaternionic Equations still elude me, though through this research, I think I\u2019m getting closer to them! Wikipedia FINALLY has some elucidations. The Ionosphere\u2019s existence was proven by Appleton and Barnett in 1925. These events were all precursors to Schumann\u2019s elucidations on these geomagnetic resonances. Having learned this much about them, I am now much less non-committal about the significance of geomagnetic waves in biology. In an intuitive way, I sense merit in Riggs\u2019s assertions. The base frequency Schumann Resonance and the next one or two \u201charmonics\u201d are in the range of brain wave frequencies. And because Schumann waves propagate around and around the globe within a spherical confine and give rise to surface waves at the high and low altitude extremes, there is the likely manifestation of longitudinal electromagnetic waves with a gravitational component, further likening them to brainwaves. Moreover, because lightning stimulates Schumann Resonances, but also creates plasma from extreme voltage potential, longitudinal waves are generated directly out of the strikes, just as they are from Tesla Coils. I\u2019m beginning to perceive possible links. Spotting the  common denominators is a habit of mine. C\u2019est tres interessant, n\u2019est ce pas? It could all lead back to the possible applications of my conceptual QRED machine. If you consider again the virulent reaction of Alf Rigg\u2019s academic opponent, you can easily see also what cutting edge scientists, inventors and medicos are so often up against.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5785\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5785\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5785\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:22 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5785#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5785\", \"5785\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>174. \u201cWhy is it that the world&#8217;s greatest minds, blessed with virtually unlimited funding have struggled to make even the humblest dent in the cancer epidemic?&#8221; Dr. Francisco Contreras, via \u201cHope \u2013 Medicine &amp; Healing\u201d by Dr. Francisco Contreras &amp; Daniel E.

Big medical advances and miracle cures are NOT part of those agendas. They jealously guard their status, prestige, wealth and power against any competition from medicos or scientists who are GENUINELY brilliant; and they behave exactly as Alf Rigg\u2019s academic opponent is described as doing in Quote #173, or worse \u2013 MUCH worse. In that, because they really aren\u2019t as bright as they\u2019d have everyone else believe and because their characters are defined more by greed and prestige than philanthropy, they are freely used for their predictable behaviour as fronts, puppets and pawns by other, more sinister minds. These other, more sinister minds ARE clever and some are even brilliant, but theirs is the cunning, unscrupulous brilliance of the Industrial CEOs and beyond even them, the hidden dynastic movers and shakers who practically own those same CEOs.

They\u2019re a waste of money!<br />\n#2: \u2018Cancer cells are powerful and hard to stop.\u2019<br />\nFacts: Cancer cells are weak. Hit them with a blast of oxygen, and they die by the millions!<br />\n#3: \u2018You just have to accept the pain, nausea, and hair loss that go along with chemo.\u2019<br />\nFacts: If chemo makes you sicker than you were to begin with, something is wrong. I know for a fact that thousands of patients have cured their cancer without misery.<br />\n#4: \u2018Cancer doctors tell you to use chemo because they believe in it.\u2019<br />\nFacts: A McGill University study showed that most cancer doctors wouldn\u2019t undergo chemo if they had cancer and they wouldn\u2019t let their families do so, either!<br />\n#5: \u2018My cancer doctor will tell me all about the most effective treatments.\u2019<br />\nFacts: Your cancer doctor could be hauled before the medical board for recommending anything other than surgery, radiation, and chemo.\u201d<br />\nBill Henderson, retired USAF Colonel, author of \u201cBill Henderson\u2019s Special Report\u201d. [Bill Henderson lost his wife to cancer under disgraceful circumstances and then did precisely what I did by spending several years researching cancer. However, he has progressed further than I, inasmuch as his \u201cBill Henderson Protocol\u201d is fairly well known and widely used \u2013 with considerable success, even by terminal patients. He also hosts a radio program in which he exposes information about cancer and its cures. The \u201cBill Henderson Protocol\u201d is based on the Johanna Budwig diet of organic cottage cheese and refrigerated flaxseed oil, but involves some additional measures. It is extensively tried, tested and proven effective. The Budwig diet is known for its excellent results against advanced cancers \u2013 the two simple ingredients, when combined in a blender and consumed as a staple foodstuff react with each other to generate an oxygenating agent that attacks malignant tissues and microbes. It also revitalises healthy tissues and the Immune System. At the same time, this food is highly nutritious and excellent for weight control. Taste? Well, that&#8217;s individual.

They didn\u2019t want the boy to suffer another round of chemotherapy. The first round of chemotherapy made the boy so sick, he couldn\u2019t stand the nausea. He vowed to fight back if they ever tried to force more of the chemo drug into him. But a court ignored the boy\u2019s wishes and ordered him to go through chemo again. The boy wanted to use natural treatments instead. But the government stepped in and ordered the mother to get her son back into chemotherapy, or else!

On the subject of Vitamin C as a cancer treatment, in March 2011, the FTC moved against a company named McGuff Pharmaceuticals, warning, &#8220;You manufacture and market unapproved new drugs in violation of Sections 505(a), 502(f)(1)[21 \u00a7\u00a7 355(a) &amp; 352(1) of the Act]&#8221; and directed the company to cease making and distributing Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (IAA) for Vitamin C Megadosing Cancer Therapy. FTC, quote sourced via Health Sciences Institute. [Special note: The quote cited the FDA as the guilty party in this case and indeed, the FDA was probably using the Federal Trade Commission as its \u201cfront\u201d authority in this case. I have corrected it to read, \u201cFTC\u201d \u2013 I hope this is accurate and if not, then the FDA would have been more directly involved. Either way, this is seen by some very angry industry watchdogs as an action by the FTC/FDA to &#8220;test the waters&#8221; before proceeding with issuing the same directives against several other American companies that also produce IAA for cancer therapy in alternative circles. This strategy is seen as a back door manoeuvre, in view of the product being used in several hospitals quite legally, including Oasis Of Hope \u2013 so it appears that they cannot shut it down from the medical treatment direction and are resorting to other means by browbeating manufacturers instead. Then with the FTC and Customs in cahoots, they can also shut down imports of the preparation and bingo! American hospitals have one less safe and effective cancer treatment option to use. Somebody has GOT to stop these hacks AND their hidden cartel bosses. Ascorbate is NOT a drug, whether \u201cNew Drug\u201d according to the FDA\u2019s arbitrary definition, or not. It is a Vitamin. Intravenous use is a mere technicality that still doesn\u2019t qualify it as a drug, since nourishing patients intravenously in hospitals is a legitimate and routine procedure and one that is not being challenged by the FDA. Treating cancer by nourishment instead of with drugs is nothing new, as demonstrated by several dedicated cancer diets. The reason its use in hospitals is not being challenged is because the FDA cannot legally win on those grounds.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5787\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5787\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5787\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:29 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5787#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5787\", \"5787\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>178. \u201cThe article [Theoretical Aspects of Autism: Causes\u2014A Review\u201d by scientist Helen Ratajczak] goes on to discuss many potential vaccine-related culprits, including the increasing number of vaccines given in a short period of time. &#8220;What I have published is highly concentrated on hypersensitivity,\u201d Ratajczak told us in an interview, &#8220;the body&#8217;s immune system being thrown out of balance.&#8221; University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Dr. Brian Strom, who has served on Institute of Medicine panels advising the government on vaccine safety says the prevailing medical opinion is that vaccines are scientifically linked to encephalopathy (brain damage), but not scientifically linked to autism. As for Ratajczak&#8217;s review, he told us he doesn&#8217;t find it remarkable. &#8220;This is a review of theories. Science is based on facts. To draw conclusions on effects of an exposure on people, you need data on people. The data on people do not support that there is a relationship. As such, any speculation about an explanation for a (non-existing) relationship is irrelevant.&#8221; Ratajczak also looks at a factor that hasn&#8217;t been widely discussed: human DNA contained in vaccines. That&#8217;s right, human DNA. Ratajczak reports that about the same time vaccine makers took most thimerosal out of most vaccines (with the exception of flu shots which still widely contain thimerosal), they began making some vaccines using human tissue. Ratajczak says human tissue is currently used in 23 vaccines. She discusses the increase in autism incidences corresponding with the introduction of human DNA to MMR [Mumps, Measles &amp; Rubella] vaccine, and suggests the two could be linked. Ratajczak also says an additional increased spike in autism occurred in 1995 when chicken pox vaccine was grown in human fetal tissue. Why could human DNA potentially cause brain damage? The way Ratajczak explained it to me: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s human DNA and recipients are humans, there&#8217;s homologous recombination tiniker. That DNA is incorporated into the host DNA. Now it&#8217;s changed, altered self and body kills it. Where is this most expressed? The neurons of the brain. Now you have body killing the brain cells and it&#8217;s an ongoing inflammation. It doesn&#8217;t stop, it continues through the life of that individual.&#8221; Dr. Strom said he was unaware that human DNA was contained in vaccines but told us, &#8220;It does not matter&#8230;Even if human DNA were then found in vaccines, it does not mean that they cause autism.&#8221; Ratajczak agrees that nobody has proven DNA causes autism; but argues nobody has shown the opposite, and scientifically, the case is still open. A number of independent scientists have said they&#8217;ve been subjected to orchestrated campaigns to discredit them when their research exposed vaccine safety issues, especially if it veered into the topic of autism. We asked Ratajczak how she came to research the controversial topic. She told us that for years while working in the pharmaceutical industry, she was restricted as to what she was allowed to publish. &#8220;I&#8217;m retired now,&#8221; she told CBS News. &#8220;I can write what I want.&#8221; CBS News reporting on Helen Ratajczak\u2019s article linking human-DNA vaccines with autism. [Here, I note several specific items the CBS article raises. 1. The body\u2019s immune system is being thrown out of balance (by vaccines in increasing number and frequency); 2. The prevailing medical opinion disagrees that vaccines are linked with autism, according to Dr. Brian Strom, who in the same breath ADMITS direct association with brain damage \u2013 so what the hell does he think autism is \u2013 sugar addiction? \u201cBrain damage\u201d is much worse and actually adds dozens of other neurological diseases to the list alongside autism, since one must be mindful already that vaccines are notorious autoimmune disease triggers; 3. Toxic Thimerosal in vaccines and if most has been taken out, that still leaves some, but wait! It\u2019s been replaced with something else to continue fuelling the global disease epidemic \u2013 recombinant human DNA and that is your autoimmune disease trigger, because as Ratajczak correctly points out, it is recombinant in humans and therefore \u201cchanges self\u201d to trigger immune response &#8211; permanently; 4. A number of scientists said they\u2019ve been subjected to orchestrated campaigns to discredit their research into vaccine safety issues and especially if it went near autism, indicating SOMEBODY behind the scenes knows precisely that vaccines and autism ARE linked, but is determined to prevent official acknowledgement by those who represent the \u201cprevailing medical opinion\u201d by merely perpetuating an apparent \u201cabsence of peer-accredited proof\u201d; 5. Ratajczak herself was restricted in what she could publish while in the employ of pharmaceutical corporation Boehringer-Ingelheim, but can now write what she wants; 6. She\u2019s not the first who was on the inside of this stinker of an industry to blow the whistle and she won\u2019t be the last. 7. Something not mentioned in this CBS news article is the advent of the infamous \u201cDanish Studies\u201d of 2002 &amp; 2003 organised by Poul Thorsen. These retrospective metastudies produced conclusions that there is no correlation between the Thimerosal-bearing MMR vaccine and the incidence of autism. The studies are widely criticised as being invalid \u2013 that they were corruptly contrived to protect sales of the vaccine and also protect the progenitors of it from litigation or prosecution. There are very strong indications that the claims correctly implicate Thorsen and colleagues in scientific fraud and Thorsen was actually indicted on charges of fraud, money laundering and \u201ctheft\u201d of up to $2 million from the Centers for Disease Control. CDC was the sponsor and major funding source for the studies \u2013 the charges against Thorsen were limited to the financial arrangements of the studies as they were disbursed through a CDC insider named Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp and had nothing to do with the study conclusions. CDC was able to get off the hook and leave Thorsen as the fall guy, yet still benefited from the work of Thorsen and colleagues. Despite the accusations against Thorsen and colleagues on the veracity and reliability of the studies, CDC and other affiliated organisations still cite the Danish Studies&#8217; conclusions to allay public concern in America about the vaccine. Even Dr. Stephen Barrett cites them in his pro-orthodox literature. So although Thimerosal is now supposedly no longer present in MMR vaccines administered to children, I am not aware of any overt official recognition of the Thimerosal-autism link; nor of any class actions of litigation that would surely arise out of a wider public awareness of the real truth.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5788\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5788\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5788\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5788#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5788\", \"5788\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>179. The standard conventional treatment for the prevention of Prostate Cancer is Avodart, Proscar, or one of the other drugs in a class known as &#8220;5-ARIs.&#8221; This class of drugs was developed to treat enlarged prostate (also known as BPH, or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia). However, it appears some pharmaceutical companies sought to extend the use of a drug beyond its approved usage. In a 2010 New England Journal of Medicine study, about 3,300 men at high risk of prostate cancer took Avodart for four years. A second group, also at high risk, took a placebo. When compared to placebo, the relative risk of any level of prostate cancer was reduced by nearly 23 per cent in the Avodart group. Keep in mind that every man between the ages of 50 and 75 is considered high risk. If asking whether it\u2019s worth the gamble, consider that according to one insider, the NEJM study doesn&#8217;t reveal why this is a rigged game. In an editorial appearing in the same NEJM issue as the Avodart study, Dr Patrick Walsh points out that Avodart and Proscar, &#8220;\u2026 do not prevent prostate cancer but merely temporarily shrink tumours that have a low potential for being lethal, and they do not reduce the risk of a positive biopsy in patients who have an elevated PSA level.&#8221; And in 2009, in the journal Prostate Cancer Discovery, Dr Walsh had this to say about Proscar: &#8220;Men will believe that it prevents cancer, will be pleased that their PSA levels fall, and will not understand the potential danger of undiagnosed high-grade disease.&#8221; Speaking specifically about the Avodart study, he said the results showed, &#8220;There was a 23% reduction in low-grade tumours that the patients would never have known they had. Does this sound like an indication to take a pill with sexual side effects that costs $4 a day?&#8221; In the NEJM study, sexual dysfunction was higher in the Avodart group. More importantly, subjects in that group were nearly twice as likely to experience heart failure compared to placebo. Recently, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed Dr Walsh&#8217;s reservations about 5-ARIs. The FDA told makers of the 5-ARI drugs to change the warnings and precautions on all labels to include new safety information about increased risk of diagnosis with high-grade prostate cancer. Dr. Patrick Walsh, Distinguished Service Professor of Urology at Baltimore&#8217;s Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the US, where he served as Urologist-in-Chief for 30 years. [Cardiotoxic drugs for the marginal reduction in prostate cancer risk&#8230; That kind of efficacy and safety in a pharmaceutical drug is par for the course. I\u2019ll research and write up on these drugs to include in Chapter Five when I get the chance.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5789\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5789\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5789\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:33 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5789#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5789\", \"5789\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>180. \u201cFor some time now I have refrained from making any comments in regard to information on the Internet concerning hydrazine sulfate. My silence has been occasioned by the hope that our federal and prominent private-sector cancer agencies would endorse the use of hydrazine sulfate, in the wake of clinical trials demonstrating its effectiveness in the treatment of cancer. But this hasn&#8217;t happened. Quite the opposite. A casual examination of the Internet shows that information in regard to hydrazine sulfate is composed of a mixture of \u201cendorsements\u201d of hydrazine sulfate from individual patients and their advocates\u2014and the seemingly authoritative disparagement of it by cancer establishment sources. It is this \u201ccondemnation\u201d of hydrazine sulfate I wish to address\u2014the scientific gobbledygook of so-called studies, side effects, carcinogenicity, toxicity, cautions, critiques and inferences woven together by our cancer agencies&#8217; most talented \u201cspin doctors\u201d into a web of outright misrepresentations, deception and scientific fraud. (As an example of this fraud, NCI has posted an entry on the Internet, \u201cdate last modified: 6/18/04,\u201d stating \u201chydrazine sulfate has shown no anticancer activity in randomized clinical trials,\u201d which as will be seen is patently untrue and does not reflect the ten years of randomized clinical trials performed by Harbor-UCLA Medical Center from 1981-1990 and the many published, peer-reviewed clinical studies based on that body of work.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold MD, Syracuse Cancer Research Insitute, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate. [The full text with references is in Chapter Eight, Article C8: \u201cThe Truth About Hydrazine Sulphate \u2013 Dr. Gold Speaks #1.\u201d More excerpts from this article are included in this series of quotes. Dr. Gold\u2019s reportage of the filthy tricks perpetrated by several organisations \u2013 NCI, ACS, AMA, GAO, FDA &amp; MSK amongst them \u2013 is eloquent and heavily supported with corroborations. It is absolutely staggering to realise how nakedly criminal and cruel these agencies have been and continue to be towards people who suffer from fatal medical conditions (especially cancer) because of profit motive and/or power politics.]</p>\n<p>181. \u201cFirst and foremost, it is important for you to know that, contrary to implications made on the Internet, clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate have been done and published in peer-reviewed medical journals which circulate worldwide. And the truth is that every single, informed-consent, controlled clinical trial of hydrazine sulfate, performed in accordance with internationally accepted criteria and standards of scientific conduct\u2014without exception\u2014has indicated efficacy and safety of the drug. The only contrary results have been the National Cancer Institute-sponsored trials of hydrazine sulfate in which incompatible agents (medications) were used with the test drug. It must be stressed that no legitimate researcher on this planet would ever knowingly use an incompatible agent\u2014or one even suspected of incompatibility\u2014in the trial of a test drug. Use of an incompatible agent in a drug test, which acts to cause a negative study, can only be the result of incompetence or deliberateness.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5790\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5790\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5790\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:36 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5790#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5790\", \"5790\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>182. \u201cSecondly, Internet sources have implicated hydrazine sulfate to be toxic or carcinogenic. Although hydrazine sulfate is carcinogenic\u2014i.e., can cause cancer\u2014in some weanling mice given the drug in their drinking water since birth, there has never been a case of human cancer reported as a result of HS therapy . (In contrast, routinely administered chemotherapy drugs are commonly carcinogenic\u2014and can produce up to 26% of \u201csecond cancers.\u201d) Perhaps more importantly, the influential medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine presented a \u201cBrief Communication\u201d (and accompanying editorial) in its December 5, 2000 issue, of a single patient who allegedly died of fatal hepatorenal failure as a result of \u201cHS\u201d therapy. The only trouble was that no firm evidence was presented in this paper that the patient in question ever took hydrazine sulfate. The authors of this article stated: \u201cWe could not obtain samples of the product he [the patient] ingested.\u201d This means there was no possibility of a direct examination of what it was the patient was taking. The authors further stated: \u201cHis blood was not tested for the presence of hydrazine.\u201d But there are simple spectrofluorometric blood tests that will confirm even the smallest residues of hydrazine sulfate ingested even months earlier. It must be emphasized that no medical journal on earth\u2014of high repute or not\u2014would publish an article and editorial based on one case, calling attention of the medical profession and public to the potential toxicity of a drug gaining in common usage, without incontrovertible, verifiable, air-tight evidence that the patient in question ever took the drug in the first place. No journal would have the ethical recklessness to disseminate an article having far-reaching public health consequences, without absolute proof of its basic assumptions. But the editors and writers of the Annals\u2014with our federal health agencies&#8217; knowledge and participation\u2014chose to disseminate their reports to the media of the world, to the medical profession of every country and to the Internet, where the public would be sure to find them. To put this situation in its proper context: While Annals chose to issue a \u201cdrug warning\u201d based on one, single presumptive case of fatal toxicity of HS in the 30 years since the drug has been in use, there are tens of thousands of authenticated chemotherapy deaths each year. Has the Annals, or other medical journals, or our federal health agencies, or the prominent private-sector cancer organizations ever let the public know this?\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>183. \u201cDespite this drug&#8217;s early promise, from the very beginning of clinical trials, HS was to be met with controversy as a function of government action. On March 8, 1976, veteran congressman James M. Hanley (Chair of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and a member of many committees and subcommittees) requested a \u201cstatus report\u201d on HS from the director of the National Cancer Institute, our country&#8217;s\u2014and the world&#8217;s\u2014largest and most influential cancer agency. Within two weeks he received a reply which stated: \u201cHydrazine sulfate has been tested in the Soviet Union at the Petrov Institute in Leningrad [St. Petersburg ]. In a clinical study directed by Dr. Michael Gershanovich, no evidence of meaningful anticancer activity was reported. This information was communicated to the NCI under the Joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Health Agreement of 1972.\u201d Days later, however, reprints of the actual study became available. Its English summary stated: \u201cClinical observations enabled us to state a definite therapeutic effect of hydrazine sulfate in patients with lymphogranulomatosis [Hodgkin&#8217;s and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas] and malignant tumors of various localizations, when other measures of specific therapy failed.\u201d This was exactly opposite of what was communicated to Congressman Hanley. In fact, the text stated that because of the highly positive findings the study was being immediately enlarged. As to whether the NCI response to Congressman Hanley represented an innocent error on the part of the NCI or a deliberate fabrication, a further letter from the NCI, dated June 22, 1976, stated: \u201cAn abstract [summary] of the Gershanovich study appeared in Cancer Therapy Abstracts (Vol. 16: No. 4 [19]75-2046), a journal published under contract to the NCI.\u201d This published abstract antedated the NCI&#8217;s response to Congressman Hanley by six months. Thus, at the time the NCI was writing to Congressman Hanley that the Soviet data were negative, the NCI already knew these data were positive.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5791\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5791\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5791\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:42 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5791#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5791\", \"5791\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>184. \u201cIt might surprise you to know that two thirds of all cancer patients who don\u2019t survive die because of a problem called Cachexia ( ka-KEK-see-a). Cachexia is a wasting process which destroys the body\u2019s muscle mass and debilitates the patient to a fatal degree. This process also occurs in advanced cases of AIDS. Almost 40 years ago, Dr, Joseph Gold, head of the Syracuse Cancer Institute in Syracuse, New York, discovered that Hydrazine Sulfate could not only reverse and prevent this wasting away process, but could also significantly inhibit tumor growth.  In some cases it caused the tumors to disappear entirely. Hydrazine Sulfate is also non-toxic, without the side effects of many conventional treatments, and is available off the shelf. It works by inhibiting \u201cGluconeogenesis,\u201d the liver\u2019s recycling of lactic acid into glucose. This sick relationship between the liver and the cancer is what causes healthy cells to starve while increasing deadly sugar, which feeds the cancer. Cancer loves sugar. Dr. Gold was inspired by a paper written by biochemist Paul Ray, explaining that Hydrazine Sulfate could shut down the enzyme that was necessary to produce glucose from lactic acid. True to his own theory, Dr. Gold had serendipitously found a real way to starve cancer. So here we go again. The American Cancer Society put Hydrazine Sulfate on it\u2019s \u201cUnproven Methods\u201d blacklist in 1976 after a clinical trial held at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan on 29 cancer patients. It condemned and stigmatized the drug, even though it was later proven that Sloan Kettering botched the tests. Dr. Gold himself visited the hospital unannounced, and discovered that the trials were not being conducted according to their joint agreements and the drug testing protocols. Some patients received doses far too high, while others were grossly under dosed. This skewed the test results, to say the least. The study\u2019s protocol called for patients to receive 60 milligrams per day for the first three days, twice a day for the next three days and three times a day for the following six weeks. Sloan was administering 90 to 100 milligrams at one time, giving some patients a 67 percent overdose. Although the testing could never be published today, the damage was done. The blacklisting by the ACS caused Dr. Gold to lose his funding and deterred other researchers from following up Dr. Gold\u2019s previous research. In 1975, a study on 84 advanced cancer patients showed that 70% of them experienced weight gain, or stopped weight loss and also reduced pain. Tumor improvement was not as gratifying, coming in at only 17%. But others were watching and conducting their own tests on Hydrazine Sulfate. The Russians at Petrov Institute in Leningrad, were conducting their own tests, with more impressive results. In a study of 48 terminal cancer patients, 35 percent had tumor reduction, and 59 percent showed a return to near normalcy or better. Then, something remarkable happened. The ACS reversed itself in 1979 and removed Hydrazine Sulfate from its blacklist; something it had done only four previous times. In 1982, Hydrazine Sulfate was removed permanently from the list. Its remarkable ability to both reduce or destroy tumors and reverse the wasting away syndrome of cachexia make it one of the most amazing treatments in the war against cancer.\u201d Dr. Yvonne Kleine, Naturopath, PhD Nutritionist. defeatosteosarcoma dot org/2010/11/dr-joseph-gold-and-hydrazine-sulfate/. [It is most unlike the ACS to reverse a blacklisting and therefore tacitly endorse Hydrazine Sulphate in this manner. Nevertheless, it is a matter of public record that ACS permanently removed Hydrazine Sulphate from its blacklist. The reasons why ACS did this remain unclear, since in Alternative Medicine circles, ACS is renowned for crookedness. Note also that MSK was neck-deep in its own dirty work, deliberately skewing clinical trials yet again! It is claimed variously that at least one in three cancer sufferers dies not from cancer itself, but from cachexia. Dr. Kleine puts the figure at two in three, while at least one campaigner claims the figure is three in four patients. So accurate figures don&#8217;t appear to be available. However, it is an established fact that people die from anorexia. I have been personally acquainted with one such woman who subsequently died and one of the most famous cases was that of the outstanding female vocalist, Karen Carpenter. In the light of these tragedies due to anorexia nervosa, it is completely safe to presume that cachexia kills most people in whom it is not reversed soon enough, regardless of whether that should prove to be in 33%, 67% or 75% of cancer sufferers.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5792\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5792\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5792\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:47 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5792#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5792\", \"5792\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>185. \u201cIn 1975 three articles would appear in the medical literature, detailing initial clinical results with hydrazine sulfate. The first, the Soviet study, a phase II controlled clinical trial, set forth astonishing results in a class of patients termed \u201cfactually terminal [stage 4],\u201d who had become unresponsive, or had failed to respond initially, to conventional therapy: 58 percent demonstrated anticachexia response (weight gain, performance status improvement, normalization of the laboratory indices, etc.), and 35 percent showed antitumor response (tumor regression or stabilization); one year later the initial series of 48 patients was enlarged to 95 patients, with essentially the same results. The second, a pharmaceutical-sponsored IND (Investigational New Drug) study of 84 terminal and preterminal patients with different types of cancer demonstrated a 59 percent anticachexia response and a 17 percent antitumor response. The third, a small study of 29 patients conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, totally uncontrolled for patient selection, drug dosage and treatment schedule, and prior and concurrent therapy, found no long-term improvements (although transient response was recorded). On the basis of this totally uncontrolled MSKCC trial of 29 patients the American Cancer Society, in March 1976, placed HS on its \u201cUnproven Methods\u201d list. The ACS stated: \u201cAfter careful study of the literature and other available information, the American Cancer Society does not have evidence that Hydrazine Sulfate is of any objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings.\u201d In its article, the ACS referenced only the uncontrolled MSKCC study, but failed to reference the phase II controlled Soviet trial or the (American) pharmaceutical-sponsored IND study. (In late 1979 the ACS removed HS from its Unproven Methods list, in the wake of increasingly positive data on HS.) In March 1979 the Soviet study was enlarged to 225 patients. Published as an abstract in the March 1979 Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, controlled for patient selection and prognosis, performance status, dosage protocol, prior and concurrent therapy, the study reported overall results of 65 percent anticachexia response and 44 percent antitumor response. Anticachexia response was described as \u201cappreciable improvement of appetite and general status, disappearance or reduction of severe weakness characteristic of the pretreatment period, reduction or complete elimination of pain, tendency toward normalization of the laboratory findings\u201d; antitumor response included tumor regression (\u201cless than 25 to greater than 50% of initial tumor volume\u201d) and tumor stabilization (from \u201c3-6 months\u201d); side effects included \u201cminimal nausea, dizziness, anorexia, polyneuritis (1.7%) [tingling of the fingers]\u201d\u2014and the absence of bone marrow depression (\u201cleukopenia and thrombocytopenia were not observed\u201d). In this class of patients no efficacy and safety findings approaching these had ever before been reported. Nevertheless, although arrangements had been made through the Soviet and American governments to have Dr. Gershanovich come to this country to discuss these results, after traveling more than 7,000 miles he was not permitted to present his paper orally at the annual scientific meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research in New Orleans. Asked by the media at this conference whether \u201cconsideration should not have been given to the fact that [this] Russian trial was the first large-scale study of [HS], purporting to show significant benefits from its use\u201d\u2014and therefore become subject to open discussion by the world oncology community\u2014the program chairman of the AACR stated: \u201cThe Gershanovich paper is not going to be presented, and that&#8217;s it.\u201d (In 1981 the Gershanovich data were published as a full-length paper in the American peer-reviewed journal, Nutrition and Cancer.)\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5793\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5793\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5793\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 7:51 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5793#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5793\", \"5793\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>186. \u201cAlso in 1979 a negative paper on HS of 25 non-randomized, non-blinded, non-controlled, open-study patients would be published in the journal Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, whose editor-in-chief was an NCI official, authored by Dr. William Regelson (now deceased) and colleagues from the Medical College of Virginia. In this totally unaudited study, 7 of the \u201cnegative\u201d patients died (of their disease, not from the drug) within 11 days of starting HS therapy (1 died on the very first day), another was \u201clost to follow-up\u201d after two weeks, 2 others received prior chemotherapy which had not yet cleared, 1 received concurrent medication shown to be incompatible with HS as long as four years previously, and 16 received HS less than the required four-week minimum (l patient received HS for only 1 day, 9 for 1 week or less, 16 for 2 weeks or less). Of the 25 \u201cnegative\u201d patients only five could qualify for evaluation according to established drug-testing protocol. Because only 20 percent of the patients of the study were evaluable, it is unclear how this paper achieved publication, since it was apparent that it could not have been subject to normal, independent peer-review procedures.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>187. \u201cIn January 1980 the Commentary section of the Journal of the American Medical Association would present another negative article on HS, again authored by Dr. Regelson. The JAMA was at the time perhaps the most authoritative medical journal in the world and its prestigious Commentary section, located at the beginning of many issues, was in effect a forum that usually addressed an important social or political medical problem or question\u2014and was thus a reflection of the views of organized medicine at its highest levels. In this Commentary article Dr. Regelson stated that he and \u201cothers\u201d had performed randomized, double-blind studies on HS that were negative. (\u201cIn both randomized double-blind and nonrandomized studies, our group and others have tested hydrazine sulfate in advanced cancer patients\u2026.\u201d) But the truth was that Dr. Regelson\u2014or \u201cothers\u201d\u2014 never performed any double-blind studies and indeed the only study that Dr. Regelson ever performed was the one, previously discussed, in which 80 percent of the patients were unevaluable and which could not have been published on the basis of independent peer-review. In fact Dr. Regelson never once mentioned the Gershanovich results\u2014the only truly controlled (phase II) clinical trial of HS up to that time (1979), which dwarfed all other studies (225/233 evaluable patients) of HS combined. (Gershanovich&#8217;s name did not appear once in the text.) Of HS Dr. Regelson only stated: \u201c[Hydrazine sulfate] does inhibit the Walker 256 carcinoma [a rat tumor] and has shown synergy with chemotherapy in the L 1210 in mice\u2026.Where does that leave us?\u201d Thus extolling the \u201cdouble-blind\u201d studies he had never published or performed, and omitting any mention of the large-scale, positive, controlled Russian trials that had been published and performed\u2014Dr. Regelson&#8217;s Commentary article sent an unmistakable message that HS was tantamount to quackery medicine, in effect regarded by the cancer establishment (he referred to himself as \u201cwe members of the Establishment\u201d) as a pharmaceutica-non-grata . Equally disconcerting was the fact that the editorial staff of the JAMA had apparently not checked to ascertain that Dr. Regelson\u2014or \u201cothers\u201d\u2014had indeed published double-blind studies on HS, in effect that what Dr. Regelson was writing was in fact true. JAMA &#8216;s failure to perform this most elementary task served only to reinforce Dr. Regelson&#8217;s egregiously erroneous \u201cmessage\u201d to the practitioners of American medicine.

DeVita, Jr., then director of the NCI. In its first edition in 1983 this textbook carried a chapter, \u201cUnproven Methods of Cancer Treatment,\u201d authored by Dr. Jane E. Henney, deputy director of the NCI (who would become Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in 1998). As expected, Dr. Henney&#8217;s chapter would not include HS, since this drug had been removed from the American Cancer Society&#8217;s Unproven List three years previously and the Soviet phase II study of 225 patients had already been published in 1981 in the American peer-reviewed journal, Nutrition and Cancer. But in this textbook&#8217;s second edition, published in 1985, in the wake of further positive clinical studies, Dr. Henney&#8217;s chapter, strangely enough, did include HS. By that time the Russian (Soviet) series had been enlarged to 356 patients, reporting essentially the same highly positive results as in earlier papers, again in very late stage, refractory patients. In her chapter, Dr. Henney characterized these Soviet results\u2014in this instance 44 percent antitumor response and 50 percent anticachexia response, previously unheard of in this class of patients\u2014as merely showing \u201chints of subjective activity.\u201d And although the watershed February 1984 Cancer Research Harbor-UCLA article\u2014and its predecessor ASCO abstracts of 198230 and 198331 \u2014were available to her before the chapter went to press (in her chapter Dr. Henney quoted a reference dated April 1984), no mention whatsoever was made of the Harbor-UCLA work.<br />\nIn subsequent editions of the DeVita textbook Dr. Henney&#8217;s chapter was entirely removed. Nevertheless, a signal was sent to the oncology world that the two highest officials of the NCI\u2014Drs. DeVita and Henney\u2014had seen fit to characterize HS as an \u201cunproven method\u201d at a time when positive data, including randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, were emergent from unimpeachable clinical sources.<br />\nHarbor-UCLA Grant Application To The NCI . On July 1, 1983 Harbor-UCLA, under the principal investigatorship of Rowan T. Chlebowski, M.D., Ph.D., considered one of this country&#8217;s leading authorities in intermediary cancer metabolism, submitted a grant application to the NCI to continue its successful, initial studies with HS and extend this salient work with the performance of an all-important clinical outcome study. Over the next few years NCI action would prove disconcerting to the Harbor-UCLA investigators. When Chlebowski and his colleagues made changes in the application recommended by the NCI study section, NCI referred the revised grant application to new and sequentially different study sections, which knew less and less about it and would demand further changes, until action by a third study section\u2014submission to three, successive study sections had never before happened to any NCI grant application\u2014would demand changes that had nothing to do with the original grant application or with changes recommended by the first, and primary, study section. In 1985 Dr. Chlebowski received notice from the NCI that his grant application had been approved but achieved only a \u201cborderline\u201d funding score, indicating a substantial uncertainty it would be funded. Chlebowski therefore sent an urgent letter to the NCI, requesting \u201cspecial funding consideration.\u201d<br />\nIn his letter Dr. Chlebowski, stated: \u201cOur cumulative data are largely in agreement with the over 300 patient Russian experience where clinical benefit was observed in approximately half the patients receiving hydrazine sulfate therapy.\u201d Emphasizing the importance of his research, he stated: \u201cIf the negative prognostic implications of weight loss in these cancer patient populations could be overcome by hydrazine sulfate\u2014[which he termed \u201crepresentative of an entirely new class of therapeutic compounds\u201d]\u2014a major therapeutic advance applicable to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients would be achieved.\u201d<br />\nChlebowski received no reply to his letter in over a month. A copy of his letter was then forwarded to the direct attention of Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services, for an \u201cunbiased review of the hydrazine sulfate situation and of Dr.Chlebowski&#8217;s letter in particular.\u201d Two months later Dr. Chlebowski received a \u201cNotice of Grant Award\u201d from the NCI for his three-year project, \u201cGlucose Metabolism and Hydrazine in Cancer Cachexia,\u201d to begin September 1, 1985.<br />\nIn 1987 three papers were published as a result of this new (and residual ACS) funding. In February Chlebowski and colleagues would demonstrate, in a full-length paper, that weight maintenance in HS-treated patients was statistically associated with an increase in the effectiveness of calories ingested, that the mean blood circulatory levels of HS nine hours following a standard oral dose (60 mg) ranged from 0 to 89 ng/ml\u2014average: 45\u00b1 16 ng/ml\u2014implying that patients who received no benefit from HS may not be absorbing it from their gastrointestinal tracts (i.e., patients with near-zero blood levels), that side effects were minimal, consisting of low levels of nausea, lightheadedness and \u201cless than 1%\u201d peripheral neuritis. In August Harbor-UCLA investigators, again in a full-length paper, demonstrated that HS reduced protein breakdown and preserved peripheral (body) muscle mass in patients with late stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); it was also found that HS acted to maintain serum albumin levels, an important prognosticator of survival in these patients.<br />\nHowever, in 1987, it would be a third paper published only in abstract form by the Harbor-UCLA investigators which would prove to be most consequential. In this abstract (and in an oral presentation at the annual scientific meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology that year) substantive evidence was presented that HS resulted in statistically increased survival in a subset of early patients with NSCLC, which had never before been reported as a result of drug therapy: HS addition to standard chemotherapy resulted in a median survival time of 328 days, vs. placebo addition to standard chemotherapy which resulted in a median survival time of 209 days, the difference being statistically significant to the p&lt;.05 level. It was the first time that a treatment directed primarily at abnormal host metabolism was demonstrated to favorably influence survival outcome in patients with malignant disease.<br />\nBy the beginning of 1988, prospectively randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies had thus indicated that HS: (a) normalized abnormal glucose metabolism, (b) resulted in increased effectiveness of ingested calories, (c) caused weight gain or weight stabilization, (d) reversed protein breakdown and muscle wasting, (e) maintained serum albumin levels, and (f) resulted in statistically significant survival increase in lung cancer patients. However, that same year NCI&#039;s Dr. DeVita, representing this country&#039;s cancer leadership at its highest levels, would pronounce HS a \u201cho-hum idea,\u201d referring to this drug as merely \u201ca therapy that gave you plumper people by the time they died\u201d (and reaffirming his statement made to the media in 1981: \u201cWe throw away drugs that are better than hydrazine sulfate\u201d).\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate. [In saying this, Dr. DeVita actually spoke the truth. They do in fact throw away better drugs than Hydrazine Sulphate. What he did NOT say however, was that they routinely KEEP drugs that are much, much worse.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5795\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5795\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5795\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:09 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5795#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5795\", \"5795\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>189. \u201cRecognizing the large therapeutic potential of HS as a result of their metabolic and clinical outcome studies, Harbor-UCLA investigators undertook to enlarge their work from a single-institutional study to a multicentric study and from examination of a single tumor type, namely lung, to three tumor types: lung, breast and colon. The institutions involved would be: Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (study headquarters), Emory University Medical Center, University of Toronto Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute. Among the co-principal investigators were some of the most distinguished names in cancer medicine and research: Dr. Dan Nixon, Dr. Murray Brennan, Dr. G. G. Boyd, and others. Dr. Chlebowski, a most experienced\u2014and successful\u2014grant writer, undertook to write the initial draft of the multi-institutional grant application, then sent it to his colleagues at the cooperating institutions for their comments, then revised it according to their recommendations. At about the time of publication of the Harbor-UCLA outcome study abstract (1987), Chlebowski sent the completed multicentric grant application to the NCI. Chlebowski, considered a \u201cluminary\u201d in the field of cancer metabolism investigation (he was one of thirteen scientists selected by the U.S. government to help establish a cancer treatment and teaching center in Taipei, Taiwan ), was shocked some months later to receive notification from the NCI that his grant application was not only not approved, but received one of the worst scores possible (at the time a perfect score was \u20181,\u201d the worst \u201c500\u201d: the number given to his application was 460). In giving Chlebowski&#8217;s multicentric application\u2014written in conjunction with some of the country&#8217;s top research institutes and scientists\u2014such a resoundingly high (poor) score, the NCI in effect gave indication of its apparent displeasure with further, independent trials of HS. Shortly thereafter, NCI\u2014the frequent and assertive adversary of HS since 1976\u2014assumed sole control of all further clinical testing of this agent.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>190. \u201cBut the Harbor-UCLA investigators, and HS, would be dealt another surprise at the hands of the cancer establishment. In early 1988, after gathering and collating all the data from its outcome study, Harbor-UCLA sought to publish a full-length paper on this study, detailing all study parameters\u2014including patient selection, concurrent medication, treatment protocols, methods of study conduct, statistical analyses, etc.\u2014in a journal of unquestioned reputation. Anticipating no difficulty in this task, Chlebowski and his co-workers sent this paper off to a mainstream, well regarded, internationally circulated cancer journal, in which they had published many times previously. This journal&#8217;s editorial board kept his paper for four months\u2014instead of the usual six weeks\u2014and then rejected it. He then submitted the paper to the Journal of Clinical Oncology \u2014a journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology \u2014considered by many as the emergent, authoritative journal for clinical studies of cancer drugs. In early 1989 the JCO agreed to publish the Harbor-UCLA paper, with \u201cmajor revisions,\u201d most of which related to methodology and details of statistical analyses. However, each time Harbor-UCLA submitted its revisions, the JCO would ask for further changes. Finally, in June 1989 Harbor-UCLA received final acceptance by the JCO, stating its paper would be published in the journal&#8217;s January 1990 issue.<br />\nBut it would not be a \u201cnormal\u201d publication. Ordinarily a journal submits to the author(s) galley proofs (page proofs) of the paper shortly before publication. These proofs are strictly of the author(s)&#8217; article and are for the express purpose of making last minute changes, additions or corrections. No galleys or proofs of any other articles or content appearing in the journal issue are ever sent to the author(s)\u2014which would be considered highly unethical. But when Chlebowski and his group received galleys of their article, included in these galleys were the galleys of yet another paper\u2014an editorial, \u201cHazards of Small Clinical Trials,\u201d taking aim exclusively at the Chlebowski paper and the conclusions reached. Up to this time no journal had ever sought to attack its own lead article. Confronted with the choice of withdrawing their paper with the understanding that the editorial, too, would be withdrawn, Chlebowski and his group chose rather to go ahead with publication.<br />\nAlthough in the January 1990 issue of the JCO Chlebowski and his group were able to demonstrate unequivocally that HS addition to chemotherapy significantly extended the lives of NSCLC patients, the effect of the editorial (which preceded the Chlebowski paper) was devastating. Written by Dr. Steven Piantadosi of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center (who at the time was also a member of FDA&#8217;s Oncology Drug Advisory Committee which recommended to the FDA which cancer drugs to approve and which not to approve), the editorial singled out only the HS results, shredding the Harbor-UCLA work on the basis that it was \u201ctoo small\u201d a clinical study to be valid. However\u2014and as pointed out in a subsequent issue of the JCO &#8211; the Chlebowski trial was comprised of 65 patients, considered adequate for any phase III single-institution trial, whereas in the same journal issue there were trials of 15, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 40, 40, 43, 49, and 51 patients, and the editorial took issue with none of these or the conclusions reached. The effect of this \u201chired-gun\u201d editorial was to dramatically curtail the use of HS in the U.S., and cast a pall over future, independent clinical research with HS, discouraging individual researchers and their sponsoring institutions from implementing any such undertakings.<br />\n(In contrast, in 1990\u2014the same year as the Piantadosi editorial\u2014HS, following approval for use throughout the Soviet Union, was named Sehydrin by the nomenclature commission of the U.S.S.R.

The second and third were conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) headquartered at the Mayo Clinic. NCI&#8217;s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), headed by Dr. Michael Friedman, held the portfolio of the planned HS studies.<br />\nHS is an irreversible and potent MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitor, a class of compounds that can have potentially deadly interactions with other drugs. For over three decades it has been known that central nervous system depressants\u2014such as barbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol\u2014are incompatible with MAO inhibitors and use of the two together could result in extremely dangerous effects. Because these agents\u2014especially tranquilizers\u2014were commonly used as supportive agents in cancer patients, CTEP and all study chairs of the planned NCI-sponsored studies were alerted that use of HS in conjunction with these agents would constitute a clinical hazard, were advised that these supportive agents should be excluded in any study of HS (if not, a negative study would result), and were provided published and unpublished data indicating deleterious interactions between the two. (For example, one of the provided studies indicated that tumor bearing rats given either a benzodiazepine tranquilizer or HS suffered no harmful effects, whereas when the two types of compounds were given together in the same doses, the rats became comatose and a 50% to 60% mortality resulted, depending on which benzodiazepine was given.) CALGB&#8217;s reply was that after careful review and discussion, \u201cbarbiturates, tranquilizers and alcohol will not be specifically excluded.\u201d<br />\nIn the June 1994 issue of the JCO, the three NCI-sponsored studies were reported as negative. Publication of these studies was apparently carefully planned, since they appeared consecutively \u2014even though they were finished at far different intervals (February 1991, October l992, November 1992). The first (CALGB) study was finished a year and a half before the last studies\u2014and held until the last studies were completed, the effect of which was that their simultaneous\u2014and sequential \u2014publication might have greater impact. In the largest of these studies it was emphasized that \u201cno patients received barbiturates and virtually no patients received phenothiazine-type tranquilizers with the exception of prochlorperazine (Compazine), which was used as a short-term anti-emetic [anti-nausea] agent.\u201d No mention was made of use of the more powerful benzodiazepine tranquilizers, the implication being that the benzodiazepine tranquilizers were not used. Tranquilizers were thus indicated as used only sparingly and for very short periods of time. Yet another\u2014fourth\u2014article on HS appeared in the same journal issue, an editorial identifying HS as a \u201cvampire\u201d and the NCI-sponsored studies as \u201cthree stakes in the heart of hydrazine sulfate.\u201d\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>192. \u201cBecause of evidence of irregularities presented to Congress, the ranking members of the Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations of the House Government Operations Committee ordered a General Accounting Office investigation of the NCI-sponsored HS studies (the GAO is the investigative arm of Congress). This investigation was commenced in June 1994 under the leadership and direction of 28-year veteran investigator Barry D. Tice, Assistant Director of the GAO, Health Planning Division. The GAO soon learned that far from the exclusion of barbiturates and short-term use of only Compazine as a tranquilizer, the CALGB study included widespread\u2014and in many cases prolonged\u2014use of a spectrum of both phenothiazine tranquilizers as well as the more powerful benzodiazepine tranquilizers, with no exclusion of barbiturates or restriction on use of alcohol. Among the phenothiazine tranquilizers used were: chlorpromazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine and triethylperazine; among the benzodiazepine tranquilizers were: alprazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam; barbiturates included: pentobarbital, phenobarbital, secobarbital and donnatal. These are among the most powerful depressants known, with such trade names as Thorazine, Compazine, Xanax, Valium, Dalmane, Ativan, Restoril, Halcion, Nembutal and Seconal. They are all incompatible\u2014and potentially dangerous\u2014with MAO inhibitors. It was ascertained that many patients in these studies received both phenothiazines and benzodiazepines, and some more than one tranquilizer at a time. As a consequence the CALGB was forced to publish a new paper clarifying the use of these agents. The new paper specified that 94% of all patients received tranquilizers, half receiving the main benzodiazepine tranquilizer used, lorazepam (Ativan), on a long-term (&gt;48 hours) basis, that the data were not computerized and that information regarding the use of concomitant medications \u201cwas not complete.\u201d At the end of this new paper the authors nevertheless maintained: \u201cThe correction and clarifications offered here do not change the conclusions originally reported from our study.\u201d\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5798\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5798\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5798\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:19 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5798#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5798\", \"5798\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>193. \u201cThe principal question of this investigation was whether or not HS was an MAO inhibitor. If so, the NCI-sponsored studies would be, by definition, intrinsically flawed (since tranquilizers were known to be incompatible with MAO inhibitors). Despite pharmacology textbooks identifying hydrazine as an irreversible MAO inhibitor over the past 30 years, the NCI vigorously denied to GAO investigators that HS was an MAO inhibitor. On September 14, 1994 Dr. Michael Friedman, associate director of CTEP and in charge of NCI&#8217;s HS studies, wrote to Dr. Vera A. Gorbunova inquiring whether \u201cRussian oncologists restrict the coadministration of hydrazine with alcohol, antiemetics, tranquilizers and barbiturates.\u201d Within three weeks he received a reply from Russian oncologist Dr. M. B. Bychkof: \u201cHydrazine sulfate is a modulator of biologic reactions\u2026it functions as an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase [MAO] and therefore cannot be used in combination with alcohol, tranquilizers and barbiturates.\u201d Nevertheless Dr. Friedman would later write to Barry Tice: \u201cThat hydrazine sulfate is an MAO inhibitor seems unsupported by our review of the data.\u201d<br />\nRepeatedly asserting that HS was not an MAO inhibitor\u2014acknowledgement by NCI of MAO inhibition by HS would be tantamount to an admission that NCI wittingly or unwittingly used known incompatible agents (\u201cnegative bias factors\u201d) in its HS studies\u2014and leaving GAO investigators confused\u2014NCI submitted to the GAO a series of nine \u201cretrospective analyses\u201d alleging that even if there were an incompatibility between HS and alcohol, tranquilizers and barbiturates, usage of these substances made no difference anyway to the studies&#8217; outcome. But these retrospective analyses were filled with statistical irrationalities and subjected to an outside, independent audit by consultant biostatistician Richard D. Wilkins, a former senior biostatistician at a major pharmaceutical company. In his 19-page report, Wilkins summarizes: \u201cThe NCI retrospective analyses, as presented, cannot statistically substantiate any claim that the use of adjunctive tranquilizers and/or barbiturates had no (deleterious) effect on hydrazine sulfate drug action or on survival outcome.\u201d<br />\nOn June 5, 1995 the GAO issued its 28-page Final Draft Report of its ten-month investigation which was, in effect, a scathing criticism of the NCI-sponsored studies, which GAO investigators stated actually contributed to, rather than clarified, the controversy surrounding HS. Its title was: \u201cNIH Actions Spur Continued Controversy Over Hydrazine Sulfate Therapy.\u201d The report stated: \u201cNCI did not conduct adequate oversight of these trials. It did not take sufficient measures to appropriately address concerns over alleged incompatible agents\u2026. The issue of possible incompatibility of hydrazine sulfate with certain other agents is unsettled\u2026.The clinical importance of possible interaction between hydrazine sulfate and tranquilizing agents, barbiturates, or alcohol has not been determined and the issue remains unsettled.\u201d This was circulated as a perfunctory courtesy to the Food and Drug Administration, the NCI, the Public Health Service and \u201cinterested congressional committees\u201d before publication as an official document. Two days later, as set forth in a published investigative article, NCI representatives met with GAO, expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d lest the Draft Report be made public, and five days later presented GAO with an 8-page memorandum \u201cdemand[ing] a major rewrite.\u201d Shortly thereafter Barry Tice was removed from his position as lead investigator and relieved of all responsibilities in this case. Three months later (September 13, 1995) GAO published its official\u2014new\u2014report of its investigation. The new title read: \u201cContrary to Allegation, NIH Hydrazine Sulfate Studies Were Not Flawed.\u201d<br />\nTice commented, regarding the changes made in the Draft Report: \u201cThere weren&#8217;t that many words changed from our Final Draft Report, but\u2026the impact of the changes and few key deletions was tremendous. Those changes took NCI almost completely off the hook\u2026.In my almost 30 years at GAO I was rarely forced to accept rewrites or deletions that\u2026significantly altered a report&#8217;s message.\u201d<br />\nTice retired from his long career at GAO soon after the altered GAO report was published. However, he was still haunted by the lingering doubt as to whether HS was an MAO inhibitor, on which, he knew rested the crux of the entire GAO investigation. As a private citizen, using his own stationery, he wrote to Robert M. Julien, M.D., Ph.D., of St. Vincent Hospital, Portland, Oregon, an acknowledged expert in the field of drug interactions and author of the seventh edition of A Primer of Drug Action\u2014whose book he had come across after leaving GAO\u2014asking whether HS was an MAO inhibitor. Tice received a timely reply indicating HS was \u201can irreversible MAO inhibitor\u201d (Dr. Julien&#8217;s emphasis).<br />\nOn October 25, 1999, four years after the NCI had so vigorously denied to GAO investigators that HS could be an MAO inhibitor, lest the NCI-sponsored studies be termed \u201cintrinsically flawed\u201d\u2014four years after the GAO investigation had safely passed\u2014NCI issued a multipage newsletter on complementary and alternative medicine, discussing HS. Its opening line was: \u201cHydrazine sulfate is an MAO inhibitor\u2026.\u201d\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>194. \u201cIn flagrant violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of January 26, 1998, the \u201cappointing authority\u201d (FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research), however, invited only those who could speak against HS to its PCAC meeting of May 7, 1999. Three outspoken adversaries of HS gave testimony (in favor of de-listing) to the committee, one of whom (charged with a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in his role in the NCI-sponsored HS studies) was not present in person but gave testimony by videotape and live telephone-hookup.<br />\nThe appointing authority issued no invitations to any qualified proponents of HS to give testimony, either in person or by videotape or by live telephone-hookup, in favor of HS, and thereby balance the \u201cpoints of view presented,\u201d as required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1998. As a result the committee\u2014sustaining a virtual blackout of information on the metabolic and clinical efficacy and safety data of the drug as presented in the peer-reviewed journals\u2014voted unanimously, 12-0, to recommend the de-listing of HS from the bulk compounding list.<br />\nOn February 6, 2001, section 353a of the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997, under which authority the PCAC voted its recommendation of May 7, 1999 to de-list HS from the bulk compounding list, was declared unconstitutional by a panel of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The FDA thereupon petitioned this court for a rehearing en banc (all 11 justices). The Court unanimously declined to do so. FDA then took this matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Justice Department arguing the FDA&#8217;s case. On April 29, 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in effect declaring section 353a\u2014and all action taken under its authority (including the recommended de-listing of HS)\u2014null and void.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5799\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5799\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5799\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:26 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5799#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5799\", \"5799\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>195. \u201cWhat could not be done to eliminate HS by official intimidation, by rigged clinical trials, by GAO complicity with the NCI, by one-sided PCAC (FDA) action, our cancer leadership sought to accomplish by enlisting what can only be termed the academic whoredom of one of this nation&#8217;s premiere medical journals.<br />\nAs alluded to previously, in its December 5, 2000 issue, the influential medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, published a \u201cBrief Communication\u201d and editorial alleging that HS caused fatal hepatorenal (liver &amp; kidney) toxicity in a single patient. There was one thing \u201cwrong,\u201d however. No proof was presented that the patient ever took HS. The authors stated: \u201cWe could not obtain samples of the product he [the patient] ingested.\u201d This meant there was no possibility of a direct examination of what it was the patient was taking. The authors further stated: \u201cHis blood was not tested for the presence of hydrazine.\u201d But there are simple blood tests that will detect even the smallest traces of the drug ingested months earlier. It must be emphasized that no medical journal anywhere\u2014of high repute or not\u2014would publish an article and editorial based on one case, calling attention of the medical profession and public to the potential toxicity of a drug gaining in common usage, without incontrovertible, verifiable, air-tight evidence that the patient ever took the drug in the first place. No journal would have the ethical recklessness to disseminate an article having far-reaching public health consequences without absolute proof of its basic assumptions. In this regard the authors wrote: \u201cIt is not necessary to be certain that a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists between the product and the adverse clinical event\u2026to file a [toxicity] report [to the FDA].\u201d The authors were in effect stating that it was not necessary to know for sure that HS caused the adverse clinical event before reporting it to the FDA. The authors then stated: \u201cThis report [the article and editorial] suggests but does not prove that hydrazine sulfate caused the liver and kidney failure.\u201d Thus, knowing full well that its position was unsubstantiated, the Annals, one of this nation&#8217;s top medical journals, went ahead anyway, disseminating its \u201cdrug alert\u201d to doctors worldwide, across the Internet and onto the front pages of newspapers everywhere\u2014without consideration to the heavy price that large numbers of cancer patients, their families and loved ones would pay if its message were incorrect.<br />\nTo understand the moral turpitude of the Annals&#8217; action, it is necessary to know that\u2014in contrast to the single, reported, presumptive case of fatal HS toxicity (in the drug&#8217;s 30 years of use)\u2014there are tens of thousands of authenticated chemotherapy fatalities, deaths from chemotherapy drugs, in this country each year. Has the Annals, or other medical journals, or our federal health agencies, or the prominent private-sector cancer agencies ever let the public know this?\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate.</p>\n<p>196. \u201cMore than 1.2 million new cases of cancer are reported in the U.S. each year; more than 600,000 Americans die from this disease annually. The Petrov (Russian) data, corroborated by the Harbor-UCLA data, indicate that of every million late stage cancer patients treated with HS, more than half a million would receive measurable symptomatic improvement, 400,000 would have their tumors cease growing or regress, and some would go on to long term survival.<br />\nIf these data are correct\u2014as seems likely\u2014the human toll, in terms of needless suffering and/or premature death, because of a lack of access to HS therapy, has been 5 million persons in the last 10 years in the U.S. alone, many more worldwide.<br />\nThe National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as private-sector cohorts, are principally responsible for this woeful public health calamity. Their sham message to the public\u2014of \u201cvalidity\u201d of the flawed NCI-sponsored studies, of potentially fatal \u201ctoxicity\u201d of HS, of \u201cvalidation\u201d by the GAO of the NCI study results\u2014has served to deceitfully undermine use of what appropriately controlled clinical trials have demonstrated to be a safe and effective drug and, in so doing, impose a public health menace on significant numbers of cancer patients worldwide.\u201d Dr. Joseph Gold, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on the therapeutic use of Hydrazine Sulphate. [Other information sources report that currently, about 2,500,000 Americans are dying from cancer annually. Very large discrepancies occur in reportage of statistics and it is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain exactly which figures are correct. That is especially so in America, because different government agencies appear to collect their own statistics and more to the point, put their own spins on the numbers according to their own agendas. So almost nothing can be completely trusted. There can be no dispute that the numbers are nevertheless huge and do in fact represent, in Dr Gold&#8217;s own words, \u201c&#8230;a woeful public health calamity\u201d.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5800\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5800\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5800\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5800#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5800\", \"5800\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>197. \u201cIt has come to the attention of the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute that the National Cancer Institute has placed the following misrepresentations on the Internet on June 18, 2004, repeated verbatim on March 3, 2005 (<a href=\"http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/hydrazinesulfate/healthprofessional/allpages/print\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/hydrazinesulfate/healthprofessional/allpages/print</a>), in regard to hydrazine sulfate:<br />\n(1) \u201cThere is only limited evidence from animal studies that hydrazine sulfate has anticancer activity.\u201d<br />\n(2) \u201cHydrazine sulfate has shown no anticancer activity in randomized clinical trials.\u201d<br />\nThe first sentence implies there have been no human studies that have demonstrated the anticancer activity of hydrazine sulfate.

However, I wonder how many people understand that these vaccines (like all other vaccines) actually fail to protect anyone from anything! Since vaccines are injected into our bodies (which is not only unnatural but also invasive), they bypass numerous natural defences normally engaged when disease or infection threaten the immune system. There is no plausible scientific evidence that vaccines are effective against specific infectious diseases. On the contrary, they do a great deal of harm by raising free radical (oxidative) stress with their toxic additives and adjuvants, especially since most people have low levels of antioxidants due to unhealthy eating habits.  I believe that the push to get as many vaccines as possible into all of us (especially the youth), is to cause permanent immune damage which shortens our lives and make us permanently reliant on more drugs until we die. These vaccines not only cause numerous chronic degenerative diseases, but in some cases even cancer&#8230; which are presently rising to pandemic levels. I also think vaccination programmes have a very sinister element of population control to them&#8230; let alone filling the pockets of greedy drug companies&#8230; at the cost of many lives. It saddens me to know that this is happening right under our noses and the victims have no knowledge nor any defence against it. I am totally disgusted with what is going on.

This attitude betrays something of a triumphalist approach to the wonders of twentieth century medicine, whereas twenty-first century American medicine in many ways has become nothing to celebrate. The vast majority of Americans were once able to leave \u201cfrontier medicine\u201d for two or three generations and enjoy medical practice and health care marked by well-trained physicians they knew and trusted, and the widespread availability of compassionate health that were accountable to their own communities. In the twenty-first century Americans now subsidize and sustain with hundreds of billions of dollars each year (16% of gross domestic product \u2013 the largest share in the world, but resulting in only the fortieth best health status among nations) a largely ineffective, inequitable, unsustainable health care system for the benefit of an unaccountable corporate-government-research complex of vested interests \u2013 marked by the arrogance and intransigence of mainstream biomedical research elites, excessive corporate profiteering through \u201cblockbuster\u201d drugs and direct-to-consumer marketing (rather than true therapeutic breakthroughs), and the mirage of \u201cbiotech\u201d cures as well as the substitution of hard-won medical knowledge and clinical judgement by insurance company bureaucracies that results in withholding of care and health care rationing (ironically, that which had been the greatest fear under the \u201csolialized medicine\u201d of a single-payer system). For several decades, many have awaited the next \u201cmiracle\u201d drug, biotech breakthrough, and, now, medical information technology for solutions to our health care crisis. This book [Fundamentals of CAM Fourth Edition teaching text, which he co-authored and edited for tertiary institutional teaching in CAM] illustrates that often it is ancient knowledge and wisdom about healing that, when adapted to new circumstances, provide truly innovative approaches to health problems. In today\u2019s economy, the health care crisis is rapidly moving toward collapse. Many Americans may find themselves back on the medical frontier, where fortunately, the natural healing and remedies once spurned (including some in this book) are still abiding in the contemporary consumer movement labelled as \u201ccomplementary/alternative medicine\u201d\u201d. Dr. Marc S. Micozzi, MD, PhD, Adjunct Professor of the Department of Physiology &amp; Biophysics at Georgetown University School of Medicine, Former Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. [Integrative Medicine or CAM (Complementary Alternative Medicine) as it is more generically named has very slowly begun to turn the tide against powerful resistance in America as it increasingly gains acceptance. Because what is quoted was written in a teaching text, Dr. Micozzi\u2019s comments are very restrained, even as he describes the faults in the American medical system, the ways it is abused and the consequent failures. It would be ironic indeed if Integrative Medicine were to eventually emerge as the dominant health care stream as a result of the complete collapse of the existing system and its crooked paradigms, yielding a relatively sudden return to something like frontier medicine by the majority! Presently, this is actually indicated to be a more likely possible outcome in America than that of a very slow takeover from mainstream medicine by CAM, which is currently driven by gradually increasing awareness amongst Americans and an ongoing lack of efficacy with intractable diseases like diabetes, arthritis and cancer. As the system collapses by rendering mainstream medicine too expensive for the government to effectively subsidise and therefore become accessible to those alone who can afford it, people will only too naturally resort to whatever alternatives are available. The irony and the blame would reside solidly with the system\u2019s worst abusers, who will have been the very cause of the new emergent medical paradigm from the ruins of the old, by virtue of causing the demise of their own source of profit sustenance. Ticks, malarial protozoa and other parasites make the very same mistake \u2013 they likewise poison their hosts to death.]</p>\n<p>202. \u201cChemo is a double-edged sword. There is a benefit from the drug and there is a harm from the drug.\u201d Dr. Otis Brawley, MD, Chief Medical Officer, American Cancer Society, quoted via HSI. [That much is obvious. But again, here it comes from the \u2018horse\u2019s mouth\u2019.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5803\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5803\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5803\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:41 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5803#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5803\", \"5803\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>203. According to Fox News and other media sources in January 2009, \u201cIn an unusually blunt letter, a group of federal scientists is complaining to the Obama transition team of widespread managerial misconduct in a division of the Food and Drug Administation.\u201d The letter communicated to the Obama administration\u2019s Transition Team following his presidential election but prior to his being sworn in, was authored by nine scientists in the employ of the FDA who review approval applications for medical devices. The letter was written on FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health official stationery. \u201cThe center is responsible for medical devices ranging from stents and breast implants to MRIs and other imaging machinery. The concerns of the nine scientists who wrote to the Transition Team echo some of the complaints from the FDA\u2019s drug review division a few years ago during the safety debacle involving the painkiller Vioxx. [\u2026] In their letter the FDA dissidents alleged that agency managers use intimidation to squelch scientific debate, leading to the approval of medical devices whose effectiveness is questionable and which may not be entirely safe. A copy of the letter, with the names of the scientists redacted, was provided to the Associated Press by a congressional official.\u201d The following passages are quoted from the letter. 1.\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that the scientific review process for medical devices at the FDA has been corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk.\u201d 2. \u201cManagers with incompatible, discordant and irrelevant scientific and clinical expertise in devices [\u2026] have ignored serious safety and effectiveness concerns of FDA experts. Managers have ordered, intimidated and coerced FDA experts to modify scientific evaluations, conclusions and recommendations in violation of the laws, rules and regulations, and to accept clinical and technical data that is not scientifically valid.\u201d 3. \u201cCurrently, there is an atmosphere at the FDA in which the honest employee fears the dishonest employee, and not the other way around.\u201d 4. [Top FDA managers] \u201ccommitted the most outrageous misconduct by ordering, coercing and intimidating FDA physicians and scientists to recommend approval, and then retaliating when the physicians and scientists refused to go along.\u201d  FDA spokeswoman Judy Leon responded, \u201cWe have been working very closely with members of the transition team and any concerns or questions they have on any issue, we will address directly with the team. Separately, the agency is actively engaged in a process to explore the staff members\u2019 concerns and take appropriate action.\u201d \u201cSenior Democratic and Republican lawmakers are urging Obama to appoint a commissioner who will shake up the FDA and restore the confidence of its working-level scientists and medical experts. But industry officials fear that approval of new drugs and devices could be delayed by endless scientific disputes \u2013 which is the agency\u2019s reputation. The FDA dissidents have previously taken their concerns to Congress and found support from lawmakers in the House. In the letter the group singled out mammography computer-aided detection devices as an example of a technology that should not have gone forward. The devices were supposed to improve breast cancer detection, but instead studies showed they were associated with false alarms that led to unnecessary breast biopsies. Since 2006, FDA experts have recommended five times against approving the devices without better clinical evidence, the letter said. In March of last year [2008] a panel of outside advisers supported some of the concerns of the FDA\u2019s in-house scientists. Nonetheless, FDA managers overruled the objections and ordered approval.\u201d \u201cFDA Nine\u201d scientists of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, via Fox News, January 2009. [The \u201cappropriate action\u201d glibly referred to by the FDA representative apparently implied damage control measures by the FDA involving covert surveillance of emails; dismissals of scientists several months later; and a lawsuit brought against the FDA by the scientists, as divulged in the following quotes.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5804\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5804\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5804\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:43 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5804#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5804\", \"5804\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>204. The \u201cFDA Nine\u201d sent this letter on Department of Health and Human Services (FDA Office of Device Evaluation) to House of Representatives member, John D. Dingell on 14th October, 2008. \u201cDear Mr. Dingell: This letter seeks your urgent intervention because serious misconduct by managers of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is interfering with our responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices for the American public and with FDA\u2019s mission to protect and promote the health of all Americans. Managers at CDRH have failed to follow the laws, rules, regulations and Agency Guidance to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and consequently, they have corrupted the scientific review of medical devices. This misconduct reaches the highest levels of CDRH management including the Center Director and Director of the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE). [1 word redacted] physicians and scientists [2-3 words redacted] at CDRH have already sought intervention from the FDA Commissioner [Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, apparently Margaret Hamburg\u2019s predecessor]. [2-3 words redacted] physicians and scientists [4-5 words redacted] are responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all [3-7 words redacted] devices before they are used on the American public. The devices we regulate are crucial and fundamental to medical practice [extensive passage redacted] devices constitute a substantial [1-2 words redacted] cost to the [1 word redacted] American health care system with more than 500 million adult and pediatric [1-2 words redacted] procedures performed every year in the United States. It is crucial for FDA to regulate medical devices based on rigorous science. A stated in the November 2007 FDA Science Board Report entitled \u2018FDA Science and Mission at Risk\u2019: \u2018A strong Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is crucial for the health of our country. The benefits of a robust, progressive Agency are enormous; the risks of a debilitated, under-performing organization are incalculable. The FDA constitutes a critical component of our nation\u2019s healthcare delivery and public health system. The FDA, as much as any public or private sector institution in this country, touches the lives, health and wellbeing of all Americans and is integral to the nation\u2019s economy and its security. The FDA\u2019s responsibilities for protecting the health of Americans are far-reaching. [\u2026] The FDA is also central to the economic health of the nation, regulating approximately $1 trillion in consumer products of 25 cents of every consumer dollar expended in this country annually. The industries that FDA regulates are among the most successful and innovative in our society, and are among the few that contribute to a positive balance of trade with other countries. The importance of the FDA in the nation\u2019s security is similarly profound. [\u2026] Thus, the nation is at risk if FDA science is at risk.\u2019 There is extensive documentary evidence that managers at CDRH have corrupted and interfered with the scientific review of medical devices. The scientific review of medical devices is required to work as follows: FDA clinical and scientific experts (\u2018FDA experts\u2019) review submissions based on the best available scientific information and in accordance with the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Code of Federal Regulations and Agency Guidance documents (when such guidance documents exist for a particular device or category of devices). FDA experts give their best scientific judgments, opinions and conclusions regarding safety and effectiveness of medical devices and make corresponding regulatory recommendations. These form the scientific and regulatory basis for managers at FDA to make final regulatory decisions (i.e., clearance or approval of medical devices). While managers can disagree with FDA experts, they cannot order, force or otherwise coerce FDA experts to change their scientific judgments, opinions, conclusions or recommendations. In accordance with the law, if managers at FDA disagree with FDA experts, managers must document their disagreements in official Agency records, must scientifically justify any contrary judgments, opinions, conclusions or recommendations and must take personal responsibility for their final regulatory decisions. The review process is well described in long existing Agency Guidance. The law requires that qualified experts make safety and effectiveness determinations based on valid scientific evidence. Managers at CDRH with no scientific or medical expertise in [1-2 words redacted] devices, or any clinical experience in the practice of medicine [2-3 words redacted], have ignored serious safety and effectiveness concerns of FDA experts and have ignored scientific regulatory requirements. To avoid accountability, these managers at CDRH have ordered, intimidated and coerced FDA experts to modify their scientific reviews, conclusions and recommendations in violation of the law. Furthermore, these managers have also ordered, intimidated and coerced FDA experts to make safety and effectiveness determinations that are not in accordance with scientific regulatory requirements, to use unsound evaluation methods, and accept clinical and technical data that is not scientifically valid nor obtained in accordance with legal requirements, such as obtaining proper informed consent from human subjects. These same managers have knowingly avoided and failed to properly document the basis of their decisions in official Agency records. Under the banner of regulatory \u2018precedent,\u2019 managers at CDRH have demanded that physicians and scientists review regulatory submissions employing methods, and accepting evidence and conclusions, that are not scientifically proven and clinically validated. These demands appear to be based on the misguided notion that because flawed methods, evidence and conclusions were used or accepted in the recent or even the remote past, we must continue to blindly and knowingly accept these flawed methods, evidence and conclusions and continue to use them as the basis for regulatory recommendations. Such invalid regulatory \u2018precedent\u2019 goes against current scientific and clinical evidence. Rather than remedy past regulatory or scientific errors after they come to light, and rather than applying the best and latest scientific knowledge and methodology, these managers at CDRH knowingly continue to make the same regulatory and scientific mistakes over and over again. Rather than recall, re-evaluate or otherwise deal with potentially unsafe or ineffective devices that are already on the market, these managers at CDRH continue to approve more devices of the same kind in a non-transparent and non-scientific manner. This is especially true of the 510(k) program but also applies to the PMA program as well as the advice and guidance given to manufacturers before they make regulatory submissions. The practices described above represent an unwarranted risk to public health and a silent danger that may only be recognized after many years. When physicians and scientists have objected to the management practices described above, managers at CDRH have engaged in reprisals and ignored these critical concerns. FDA physicians and scientists therefore contacted the Office of the Commissioner:<br />\nOn May 31, 2008, [1 word redacted] FDA physicians and scientists [4-5 words redacted] wrote to the FDA Commissioner, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach (See attached letter). [This letter is not appended to Cancer\u2019s Answers.]<br />\nThe Commissioner immediately asked Mr William McConagha, the Assistant Commissioner for Integrity and Accountability, to begin a full investigation.<br />\nSince early June 2008, FDA physicians and scientists have met with Mr. McConagha numerous times and have facilitated his investigation by providing written documentary evidence including internal emails, reviews, memos, meeting minutes, etc.<br />\nMr. McConagha has characterized the documentary evidence as \u2018compelling,\u2019 \u2018convincing\u2019 and \u2018sufficient\u2019 to justify curative and disciplinary actions. As a result, the Commissioner met with CDRH Director in August.<br />\nOn September 3, 2008, [1 word redacted] FDA physicians and scientists [4-6 words redacted] met with the Director of CDRH in the presence of representatives from the Commissioner\u2019s Office. At the request of Mr. McConagha, the FDA physicians and scientists presented the issues and documentary evidence to the Director of CDRH (See attached presentation). [This presentation is not appended to Cancer\u2019s Answers.]<br />\nThe Director of CDRH then conducted his own investigation and concluded that we, FDA physicians and scientists need to \u2018move forward,\u2019 thus allowing managers to avoid and evade any accountability and without taking any curative or disciplinary actions whatsoever. The Director of CDRH has further aggravated the situation by knowingly allowing a continuation of management reprisals. These reprisals now include removal and threatened removal of physicians and scientists [3-5 words redacted] as well as illegal and improper employee performance evaluations.<br />\nOn September 29, 2008, [1 word redacted] FDA physicians and scientists wrote a second letter to Dr. von Eschenbach (see attached letter). [This letter is not appended to Cancer\u2019s Answers.]<br />\nTo date, despite involvement by the Commissioners Office, there has been enormous internal resistance from entrenched managers at CDRH including the Center Director and the Director of ODE. These managers seem far more concerned about ensuring their current positions and protecting and promoting their own careers and those of their cronies, than they are about ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and protecting and promoting the health of all Americans. CDRH managers prefer to employ regulation-based \u2018pseudo-science\u2019 rather than science-based regulation. It is evident that managers at CDRH have deviated from FDA\u2019s mission to identify and address underlying problems with medical devices before they cause irreparable harm, and this deviation has placed American people at risk. Given the large number of [2 words redacted] submissions to the FDA, the complexity of the scientific and medical issues involved and the importance of [1 word redacted] to the practice of medicine, we believe that proper regulation of [1 word redacted] devices requires the establishment of a new and separate Office at FDA [2-4 words redacted]. This Office must be staffed by expert physicians and scientists at all levels including management and must provide vision and leadership by being proactive rather than reactive, by incorporating the latest scientific and technological evidence into device evaluation, compliance and post-market surveillance, and by making all regulatory decisions in a transparent manner based on sound scientific and clinical principles. At the same time, there is a need for new legislation that modernizes the regulatory structure of the 510(k) program so that complex medical devices are not allowed onto the market without a comprehensive (or in some cases, any) clinical evaluation of their safety and effectiveness. This is especially true for [1 word redacted] devices due to their markedly increased use in clinical practice and because [1 word redacted] devices employ highly complex hardware and software, undergo rapid technological changes and touch the lives of so many patients on a daily basis. The current framework for medical device adverse event reporting does not work for many {1 word redacted] devices [3-5 words redacted] as the adverse effects of [1 word redacted] devices are rarely detected immediately, are not transparent on an individual patient basis, and can only be prevented by a rigorous pre-market evaluation process. FDA leaders need to re-establish the trust of the American people. Congress needs to ensure that FDA physicians and scientists can do their jobs by being allowed to follow the laws, rules and regulations without fear of reprisal, by applying the best and latest scientific knowledge and methodologies, by having an updated modern regulatory structure, and by allocating sufficient financial and other resources to FDA. Finally FDA leaders and Congress must restore compliance with the law, must hold accountable those managers at FDA that fail to carry out the FDA mission to protect and promote the health of all Americans, and must protect FD physicians and scientists so that they can protect the American public. As the Branch of government responsible for oversight of the FDA, we urgently seek your intervention and help. [signatories redacted]. The \u201cFDA Nine\u201d dissident scientists and physicians charged with assessing medical devices at the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). [Bold blue letters indicate commencement of new paragraphs in the text. These \u201cFDA Nine\u201d physicians and scientists must be commended for their courage in challenging the crooked status quo within the FDA, but while many of the measures recommended (especially disciplinary action against the offenders including but not limited to criminal charges, plus thorough retrospective re-evaluation of past FDA approvals) are well founded, there are some of these lattermost recommendations whose enactment might only serve the greater good temporarily. Unfortunately, the managers referred to are pressured and backed by very powerful forces. These forces have a will and they\u2019ll inevitably find ways of circumventing the safeguards, checks and balances of an overhauled system; so it would only be a matter of time before things returned to the unsatisfactory ways that have been manifest for the past nine or more decades \u2013 that is, unless the entire commercially oriented medical culture in America could be changed. It\u2019s incredibly unlikely and failing that kind of radical evolution, then at some point, if there is an oversight office staffed by physicians and scientists, the key members will be blackmailed, threatened or bought in much the same way as the managers currently are.

The \u201cFDA Nine\u201d sent this letter on Department of Health and Human Serices (FDA Office of Device Evaluation) letterhead stationery directly to President Obama on 26th Juanuary, 2009. \u201cDear Mr. President: We, physicians and scientists of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), wrote to Mr. Podesta and Members of Congress in a letter dated January 7, 2009. We informed Mr. Podesta that FDA is fundamentally broken and that there is an atmosphere at FDA in which the honest employee fears the dishonest employee and where honest employees committed to integrity and the FDA mission cannot act without fear of reprisal. We recommended that you remove and hold accountable all managers who have ordered, participated in, fostered or tolerated the well-documented corruption, wrongdoing and retaliation at the Agency. In November 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter to the FDA Commissioner stating that they had \u2018received compelling evidence of serious wrongdoing \u2026 and well-documented allegations \u2026 from a large group of scientists and physicians \u2026 who report misconduct within CDRH that represent an unwarranted risk to public health and a silent danger that may only be recognized after many years \u2026 and that physicians and scientists within CDRH who objected [to the misconduct] \u2026 have been subject to reprisals.\u2019 It has been brought to our attention that FDA management may have just recently ordered the FDA Office of Criminal Investigation (OCI) to investigate us, rather than the managers who have engaged in wrongdoing! It is an outrage that our own Agency would step up the retaliation to such a level because we have reported their wrongdoing to the United States Congress. FDA management has ignored the dire warnings from the United States Congress that all FDA managers immediately cease and desist from engaging in prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 USC 2302, making false statements in government documents in violation of 18 USC 1001, interfering with a Congressional inquiry in violation of 18 USC 1505, or denying or interfering with an employees [sic] right to furnish information to the Congress in violation of 5 USC 7211. We note that violation of 18 USC 1505 subjects the violators to \u2018be fined [or] imprisoned not more than five years.\u2019 We are asking for your immediate intervention. We are confident that you will follow through on your promises to protect \u2018government employees committed to public integrity and willing to speak out\u2019 because you have stated that \u2018such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled\u2019 in order to \u2018empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance.\u2019 This is the charge that America desperately seeks and has rightfully brought you to power. Sincerely, Robert C. Smith, MD, JD; Paul T Hardy II, BS; Ewa Czerska, PhD; [redacted]\u201d The \u201cFDA Nine\u201d dissident scientists and physicians of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, FDA.

The doctors and scientists who researched the products approached members of Congress and the incoming Obama administration to express alarm that the devices were approved over their objections. Their lawsuit, first reported Monday [20th January, 2012?] by the Washington Post, says the agency monitored email sent from their personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts from work computers over two years. It says those emails included messages to congressional staff and drafts of whistleblower complaints. The staffers say they were legally protected whistleblowers and the monitoring violated their constitutional rights to free speech and against illegal search and seizure, even though a warning on FDA computers said they had no expectation to privacy. The defendants [sic \u2013 this should read, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d] say they were admonished or lost their contracts to work with FDA in retaliation. The FDA said Monday it would not comment on ongoing litigation. The lawsuit says the plaintiffs were among those who complained in fall 2008 to members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that senior managers at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health \u2018ordered, intimidated, and coerced FDA experts to modify their scientific reviews, conclusions and recommendations in violation of the law.\u2019 Then in January 2009, after Barack Obama\u2019s election but before he was sworn into office, nine FDA employees sent a letter to the Obama transition team complaining of corruption within the FDA device review process that they said was endangering public health. For example, the FDA scientists alleged that the agency approved the use of computer-aided detection devices with breast mammograms even though they had been determined not to be safe or effective, harming women and resulting in unnecessary public health costs. The suit says FDA officials began secretly referring to the letter\u2019s signatories as the \u201cFDA 9\u201d and began the secret monitoring. The suit says he agency used spyware on their government-owned computers that allowed them to take \u2018screen shots,\u2019 or pictures of what was on their computer screens without their knowledge. The scientists\u2019 complaints were the subject of a New York Times article on March 28, 2010, that said FDA brushed aside its own experts\u2019 warnings about the risks of radiation exposure from routinely using powerful CT scans to screen patients for colon cancer. The lawsuit says lawyers for General Electric Co., which applied for agency approval of CT scans for colon cancer screenings, complained that confidential information may have been leaked to the Times. Agency officials used the letter to make a criminal referral to the Office of Inspector General and attempt to have the plaintiffs investigated and potentially charged with serious crimes, the suit says. But the IG\u2019s office found no evidence of criminal conduct and noted that disclosures relating to public safety to Congress and the media were protected whistleblower activity. The attorney who filed the suit, National Whistleblowers Center Executive Director Stephen Kohn, said spying on employees who raise health concerns stops others from coming forward in the interest of public safety. \u2018The FDA\u2019s illegal spying program is not just a problem for the six victims in this case,\u2019 Kohn said in a statement Monday. \u2018The day we allow the government to spy on employees based on their lawful whistleblower activities is the day we give up privacy for every honest public servant in America.\u2019\u201d Cleveland.com news media, 30th January, 2012, reporting on fallout from the \u201cFDA Nine\u201d scandal.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5807\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5807\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5807\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 8:51 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5807#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5807\", \"5807\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>207. \u201cA wide-ranging surveillance operation by the Food and Drug Administration against a group of its own scientists used an enemies list of sorts as it secretly captured thousands of e-mails that the disgruntled scientists sent privately to members of Congress, lawyers, labor officials, journalists and even President Obama, previously undisclosed records show. What began as a narrow investigation into the possible leaking of confidential agency information by five [sic] scientists quickly grew in mid-2010 into a much broader campaign to counter outside critics of the agency\u2019s medical review process, according to the cache of more than 80,000 pages of computer documents generated by the surveillance effort. Moving to quell what one memorandum called the \u2018collaboration\u2019 of the FDA\u2019s opponents, the surveillance operation identified 21 agency employees, Congressional officials, outside medical researchers and journalists thought to be working together to put out negative and \u2018defamatory\u2019 information about the agency. FDA officials defended the surveillance operation, saying that the computer monitoring was limited to the five scientists suspected of leaking confidential information about the safety and design of medical devices. While they acknowledged that the surveillance tracked the communications that the scientists had with Congressional officials, journalists and others, they said it was never intended to impede those communications, but only to determine whether information was being improperly shared. The agency, using so-called spy software designed to help employers monitor workers, captured screen images from the government laptops of the five scientists as they were being used at work or at home. The software tracked their keystrokes, intercepted their personal e-mails, copied the documents on their personal thumb drives and even followed their messages line by line as they were being drafted, the documents show\u2026\u201d The Age Of Autism website, reporting on fallout from the \u201cFDA Nine\u201d scandal.</p>\n<p>208.

He also is the author of H.R. 1483, the Drug Safety Enhancement Act, which would give the FDA more authority and funding to oversee the U.S. drug supply. Another article about the scandal\u2014FDA Whistleblowers Sue Agency, Claim Retaliation Over Unsafe Medical Device Revelations January 20, 2012 ~ What\u2019s going on inside the FDA? Six of the \u201cFDA Nine\u201d whistleblowers are suing the agency for illegally spying on their private email claiming they were retaliated against after they warned lawmakers that unsafe medical devices were being approved for market. You may recall as President Obama was taking office on January 7, 2009, nine scientists alerted him to the internal problems, accusing the agency of acting illegally by approving flawed and defective medical devices for sale even when others within the FDA objected because of safety issues. One medical device cited as problematic was the computer-aided breast mammograms, [sic] \u2018the FDA approved the devices anyway in a flawed process that ignored the science. This had led to significant harm to large numbers of women and significant unnecessary cost to the public.\u2019 After that, the staffers said the FDA spied on their private emails, harassed them and in some cases fired the whistleblowers. Internally the group was known as the \u2018FDA Nine\u2019. The federal lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia charges the agency with 12 counts and names FDA chief Margaret Hamburg, M.D., Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., William Maisel, M.D., and HHS chief Kathleen Sebelius accusing them of retaliation, among other things: \u2018Defendants have taken and converted private emails without due process or just compensation in violation of the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution.

They are considered superfluous in view of Greg&#8217;s erstwhile presence on this site, so I have not posted them. </p>\n<p>215. &#8220;I never dreamed that my discovery four decades ago would lead to such a profit-driven public health disaster. The medical community must confront reality and stop the inappropriate use of P.S.A. screening. Doing so would save billions of dollars and rescue millions of men from unnecessary, debilitating treatments.&#8221;  Dr. Richard Ablin, inventor of the Prostate Specific Antigen Test, 1970. [Dr. Ablin now calls it &#8220;the Great Prostate Mistake.&#8221; He&#8217;s never had the test himself&#8230; not once. Ablin says the test simply reveals how much prostate antigen is in the blood \u2013 not why it&#8217;s there. It doesn&#8217;t detect cancer and it can&#8217;t tell the difference between a lethal and non-lethal cancer. Researchers concluded that the PSA test is flawed because it results in &#8220;over diagnosis&#8221; \u2013 as high as 50% of the time \u2013 of slow-growing tumours that would never have been a real problem. PSA levels fluctuate all the time, so a man with a high level may NOT have any prostate problems at all. Other factors can raise PSA, such as infection, or enlargement of the prostate that happens to most men after the age of 50; and even ejaculation within two days before a PSA test can cause levels to spike and result in a &#8220;false positive.&#8221; Dr. Thomas Stamey \u2013 a Stanford urologist who originally promoted the PSA test \u2013 agrees with Dr. Ablin. 25 years ago he had high hopes that the PSA test would find cancer and save lives. Now, with the number of false positives that are actually found, he says it&#8217;s a test that DOESN&#8217;T WORK. It flags benign prostate enlargement 98% of the time and a paltry 2% success rate means the test is doing more harm than good. Firstly, there&#8217;s the invasive biospy and perhaps following that if cancer is detected (because there&#8217;s no clear distinction made by such biopsies between lethal and non-lethal cancers), pressure follows to undertake what basically amounts to chemical or surgical castration. Men with positive diagnoses have to make an agonising decision&#8230; whether or not to get crippling cancer treatments that could cause them to lose their hair, wear nappies and forget about sex. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to get the PSA test. Heavily promoted by Big Pharma, it&#8217;s a $3 billion business every year.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5809\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5809\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5809\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 9:01 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5809#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5809\", \"5809\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>216. \u201cYou don&#8217;t hear much about magnesium, yet an estimated 80 percent of Americans are deficient in this important mineral and the health consequences of deficiency are significant. One reason could be because magnesium, like vitamin D, serves so many functions it&#8217;s hard to corral. As reported by GreenMedInfo, researchers have now detected 3,751 magnesium binding sites on human proteins, indicating that its role in human health and disease may have been vastly underestimated. Magnesium is also found in more than 300 different enzymes in your body, which are responsible for:<br />\nCreation of ATP (adenosine triphospate), the energy molecules of your body;<br />\nProper formation of bones and teeth;<br />\nRelaxation of blood vessels;<br />\nAction of your heart muscle;<br />\nPromotion of proper bowel function;<br />\nRegulation of blood sugar levels.<br />\nA number of studies have previously shown magnesium can benefit your blood pressure and help prevent sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, and stroke. For example, one meta-analysis published earlier this year in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at a total of seven studies collectively covering more than 240,000 participants. The results showed that dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of ischemic stroke. But its role in human health appears to be far more complex than previously thought, and\u2014like vitamin D\u2014its benefits may be more far-reaching than we&#8217;ve imagined. GreenMedInfo.com&#8217;s database project has indexed over 100 health benefits of magnesium so far, including therapeutic benefits for:<br />\nFibromyalgia;<br />\nAtrial fibrillation;<br />\nType 2 diabetes;<br />\nPremenstrual syndrome;<br />\nCardiovascular disease;<br />\nMigraine;<br />\nAging;<br />\nMortality.<br />\nAccording to the featured report: &#8216;The proteome, or entire set of proteins expressed by the human genome, contains well over 100,000 distinct protein structures, despite the fact that there are believed to be only 20,300 protein-coding genes in the human genome. The discovery of the &#8220;magneseome,&#8221; as its being called, adds additional complexity to the picture, indicating that the presence or absence of adequate levels of this basic mineral may epigenetically alter the expression and behavior of the proteins in our body, thereby altering the course of both health and disease.&#8217; Magnesium also plays a role in your body&#8217;s detoxification processes and therefore is important for helping to prevent damage from environmental chemicals, heavy metals and other toxins. Even glutathione, your body&#8217;s most powerful antioxidant that has even been called &#8220;the master antioxidant,&#8221; requires magnesium for its synthesis.\u201d Dr. Joseph M. Mercola DO, Osteopath, Physician &amp; Surgeon, Medical Author. [This quote is a sampling from a rather excellent website maintained by Dr. Mercola and it highlights the importance of Magnesium beyond even my own previously held knowledge of it. It is critical amongst these many other things to the correct utilisation of Calcium and therefore its deficiency is indirectly linked to Osteoporosis, some cases of Alzheimer&#8217;s, atherosclerosis and a number of other diseases. Do mainstream health information sources tell you much about Magnesium? I cannot authoritatively answer that. However, I CAN say that I consistently get my best quality and most reliable information from alternative health advocacy sources. This one is a good example. The site is <a href=\"http://www.mercola.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mercola.com</a> and I recommend it. Chlorophyll-rich plants or algae are the best natural sources of Magnesium. Two of the best forms of supplemental Magnesium for correcting a deficiency are Magnesium Glycinate and Magnesium Chloride, due to very low ionic stability constants \u2013 they dissociate into ions very easily. Magnesium Chloride has the added advantage of being transdermal \u2013 it will absorb through the skin. A cheap, yet excellent quality product is \u201cAncient Minerals\u201d, sold as a bath salt. Others tend either to exhibit poor bioavailability, or produce other physiological effects, such as stool softening, laxative or antacid effects. If you take a magnesium supplement, you must also pay attention to your ratios of Calcium, Vitamin K2, Vitamin D and saturated animal fats, as these nutrients work together synergistically.]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5810\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5810\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5810\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 12, 2013 at 9:05 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5810#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5810\", \"5810\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>217. \u201cYou are wise to question who you can trust when it comes to maintaining, enhancing or rebuilding your health. With all websites, newspapers, magazines and other publications offering health advice, with every new multi-million dollar TV ad for another proclaimed miracle drug, with any recommendation offered by traditional and natural physicians, it is essential to answer this question above all others: what is their real motivation? Only if the answer provides you with a sense of security, move on to the next important question: what are their qualifications? The primary trick of the existing medical establishment is to get you to forget that first question &#8211; their real motivation &#8211; by dazzling you with what appears to be magnificently trustworthy qualifications. But clinical trials conducted by heavily biased &#8220;researchers,&#8221; advertisements and news stories carefully scripted to scare you into belief, highly polished corporate offices and corporate websites, and an extreme focus on whatever has the most profit potential &#8211; not lifesaving or life-enhancing potential &#8211; are not qualifications. They are scams. Don&#8217;t fall for them.\u201d Dr. Joseph M. Mercola DO, Osteopath, Physician &amp; Surgeon, Medical Author. [This point made by Dr. Mercola is an important one. Glitz and glamour with &#8216;magnificently trustworthy qualifications&#8217; are favourite commercial and even political tricks, especially in America, where marketing is a highly evolved science. I have dealt with &#8216;clinical trials conducted by heavily biased researchers&#8217; at length already. Remember that exactly as Dr. Mercola says, you need to look at motive. Refer back to my Detective&#8217;s Investigative Principles (DIP) in the previous Chapter 3A.] </p>\n<p>218. \u201cIf I contracted cancer, I would never go to a standard cancer treatment centre.

Over the last  decade, some 5 million Americans died of cancer and there is growing evidence that a substantial proportion of these deaths was avoidable. Furthermore, the cancer establishment and major pharmaceutical companies have repeatedly made extravagant and unfounded claims for dramatic advances in the treatment and cure of cancer. Such claims are  generally based on an initial reduction in tumour size (tumour response) rather than on prolongation of survival, let alone on quality of life, which is often devastated by highly toxic treatments.\u201d Dr. Samuel Epstein,.

Warning Against The Hoxsey Cancer Treatment&#8230; Sufferers from cancer, their families, physicians and all concerned with the cure of cancer patients are hereby advised and warned that the Hoxsey treatment for internal cancer has been found worthless by two Federal courts. The Hoxsey treatment costs $400 plus $60 in additional fees \u2013 expenditures which will yield nothing of value in the cure of cancer. It consists essentially of simple drugs which are worthless for treating cancer. The Food and Drug Administration conducted a thorough investigation of the Hoxsey treatment and the cases which were claimed to have been cured. Not a single verified case of internal cancer by this treatment has been found. Those afflicted with cancer are warned not to be misled by the false promise that the Hoxsey cancer treatment will cure or alleviate their condition. Cancer can be cured only through surgery or radiation. Death from cancer is inevitable when cancer patients fail to obtain proper medical treatment because of the lure of a painless cure \u201cwithout the use of surgery, x-ray or radium\u201d as claimed by Hoxsey. Anyone planning to try this treatment should get the facts about it. For further information write to: U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare&#8230; Food and Drug Administration&#8230; Washington 25, DC.\u201d FDA warning released April 1956, reproduced from the image at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoxsey_Therapy. [This is one I just could not resist adding to Cancer Quotes, because it directly quotes the FDA in an official public information release. Key statements in this press release are, \u201c&#8230;expenditures which will yield nothing of value in the cure of cancer. It consists of simple drugs which are worthless for treating cancer&#8230;\u201d; \u201c&#8230;misled by the false promise that the Hoxsey treatment will cure or alleviate their condition.\u201d; \u201cCancer can be cured only through surgery or radiation.\u201d; and \u201cDeath from cancer is inevitable when cancer patients fail to obtain proper medical treatment because of the lure of a painless cure&#8230;\u201d  Note that chemotherapy isn&#8217;t even mentioned at all and the article exhorts people to believe that surgery and radiation are the only ways to cure cancer. Now, it is an incontrovertible fact that NEITHER of these two orthodox modalities does any such thing as cure cancer. THEY DO NOT. NOT EVER. PERIOD. Surgery NEVER removes the cause of cancer and as for radiation \u2013 it is an almost universal FAILURE that usually causes massive collateral damage and often ADDS A CANCER CAUSE that rears its ugly face from months to years later, IF the patient even survives that long in the first place. On these lattermost premises alone, this official FDA release is a collection of the very filthiest of lies and nothing less. And since when has death ever been inevitable if patients fail to obtain \u201cproper treatment\u201d, by which it is obviously implied to mean surgery and radiation? But that&#8217;s not all. In rebuttal of the first two of these key excerpts, \u201c&#8230;expenditures &amp;c.\u201d and \u201c&#8230;misled &amp;c.\u201d, I use the following summation reported of Dr. James A. Duke. According to this very highly respected botanist of the United States Department of Agriculture, eight of the nine Hoxsey-tonic herbs have some anti-tumour activity in animal models, five have antioxidant effects, and all nine have antimicrobial activity that may be linked to cancer-fighting effects. I use Duke&#8217;s Database extensively and his assessment was that the Hoxsey tonic ingredients showed very significant chemical and biological anticancer activity. The FDA&#8217;s allegedly thorough investigation of the Hoxsey treatment involved the FDA, National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Yes, all the very worst and most dishonest cancer organisations in America if not the world, if you exclude M.D. Anderson on the basis that I have not found incriminating information about this one particular institution. About the others, I have a great deal.]</p>\n<p>221. \u201cWARNING&#8230; ALDARA, sold for skin cancer and genital warts CAN KILL. My warnings have been ignored since October, 2005.

You have to get with the cause. We control the destiny of our health. We control the quality of our health. We choose that, every day.\u201d Dr. Robert Young, PhD, microbiologist &amp; author, \u201cThe pH Miracle\u201d.</p>\n<p>232. \u201cIt&#8217;s sure, he&#8217;s on the right tr&#8230; [\u201ctrack\u201d is not fully articulated. Bernardo speaks of comments by Burton Goldberg, also present and speaking during the video-recorded interview. Three words are unintelligible  before this next sentence.] &#8230;We spent trillions of dollars&#8230; Y&#8217;know, we&#8217;re winnin&#8217; the war&#8230; Hell, we&#8217;re not doin&#8217; a damn thing. We&#8217;re losin&#8217; the rest. One out of two people, that&#8217;s 50% of people have cancer right now. Ah, one of the things that we found out was that all cancer patients \u2013 their pH is acid. You have surgery for colon cancer, it will always \u2013 ALWAYS \u2013 come back&#8230; Why? They deny and [1 unintelligible word]. The problem is ACIDOSIS.\u201d Dr. Bernardo. [Dr. Bernardo is a passionate man and speaks fast, but doesn&#8217;t enunciate his words very well. Nevertheless, I managed to capture most of what he said.]</p>\n<p>233. \u201c The minute you&#8217;re diagnosed, your immune system goes in the basement. I mean, you&#8217;re in fear. I know. It happened to me. At the turn of the century from 18 to 1900, when my daddy was born, 3% of the US population had cancer of any kind, shape or form. I&#8217;ve had cancer twice. It&#8217;s not a question of, \u201cWill I have cancer?\u201d It&#8217;s really a question of \u201cWhen?\u201d I would rank the American Medical Association on a one to ten scale&#8230; minus three hundred. They don&#8217;t don&#8217;t know how to go to the causes \u2013 they don&#8217;t know the causes. In my book, \u201cAlternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide&#8230;\u201d I did with two doctors, we had thirty-three categories of the causes of cancer and you have to find which of those categories are in that person. You don&#8217;t treat cancer \u2013 you treat the person who has the cancer. The pharmaceutical, chemical industrial complex \u2013 that is aided and abetted by the media. That&#8217;s why this documentary is so very vital. Because this information isn&#8217;t gonna come from 20/20 on ABC. How come I know this \u2013 an Honorary Doctorate? The National Cancer Institute doesn&#8217;t wanna know. The American Cancer Society doesn&#8217;t wanna know. You don&#8217;t vote \u2013 you get the kinda government you deserve. You vote and you vote people in who will create a national health insurance so that everybody is covered. It&#8217;s pathetic. And there&#8217;s no bigger earner than the petrochemical and the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 they&#8217;ll sell you down the river \u2013 for their profits.\u201d  Burton Goldberg, Honorary Doctorate, Author, \u201cAlternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide To Cancer\u201d. [This statement to the effect that the Immune System goes into the basement when cancer is diagnosed is very true, even without recourse to immunosuppression by chemotherapy. It&#8217;s closely connected to the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. Fear tends to deactivate healing and recuperative mechanisms in favour of combat, pain suppression and survival mechanisms. The concept of why it is observed to happen in humans is explained elsewhere in Cancer&#8217;s Answers. The \u201cvital documentary\u201d referred to is the YouTube video clip from which this quote was taken.]</p>\n<p>234. \u201cHow &#8217;bout a minus two&#8230; two thousand?\u201d Dr. Bernardo. [This was his rejoinder to Burton Goldberg&#8217;s \u201cminus 300\u201d remark.]</p>\n<p>235. \u201cThere&#8217;s more damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation than there is benefit. Well, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. The medical system has been a terrible failure, a corrupt system&#8230;\u201d  Dr. Wallach. </p>\n<p>236. INTERVIEWER: \u201cWhat was the thing clicked in your brain one day that made you decide to not be so narrow-minded&#8230;?\u201d<br />\n\tDr. FORSYTHE: \u201cWe were seeing these patients and ah, to my amazement they were doing very well and this was a real awakening to me \u2013 why they should be doing well when they weren&#8217;t getting what I always learned was the only way to treat cancer.\u201d  Dr. James W.

Laetrile is a semi-syntheitc substance that does not occur naturally. It is a monoglucoside built on a single glucose unit attached to a cyanide unit and a benzaldehyde unit.</p>\n<p>To be sure, its biological properties are very much the same as those of Amygdalin, which is the naturally occurring one &#8211; especially in rosaceous seeds. The difference? Not much &#8211; Amygdalin is a diglucoside, so it has two glucose units. The rest is the same as with Laetrile.</p>\n<p>Most so-called Laetrile is actually Amygdalin &#8211; there have only been two facilities in the world ever to have manufactured Laetrile to my knowledge &#8211; one in the USA and one in Germany. Stuff sourced from Mexico is natural Amygdalin extracted from apricot pips and purified.</p>\n<p>There are other Nitrilosides, as these are called.</p>\n<p>Linamarin is found in Cassava and some related fabaceous plants (beans). This one is described as a natural monoglucoside of acetone cyanohydrin. That means there&#8217;s a cyanide unit attached to an acetylketone unit and this in turn attaches to the glucose through the ketone, which thus forms an ether link (oxygen coupling) with the glucose ring.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s Lotaustralin, which is very similar to Linamarin.and found in most of the plants that express Linamarin.  Also a monoglucoside, the cyanide unit attaches to a methyl-ethylketone unit, which likewise attaches to the glucose unit through the ketone and again, this forms an ether link.</p>\n<p>All of these are anticarcinomic. They are selective cytotoxins. Not much research has be done with these latter two bean-derived nitrilosides, but with Laetrile and Amygdalin, it&#8217;s a different story.</p>\n<p>Cleavage of the nitriloside by an enzyme results in separation of the constituent units. Until this cleavage occurs, the Laetrile or Amygdalin molecule exhibits no overt bioactivity except moderately good water-solubility and the natural tendency to bind with glucoreceptors on cell membranes, which then import the whole molecule into the cell.. But with the separated components, it&#8217;s different. The cyanide unit is cytotoxic and the benzaldehyde unit is slightly cytotoxic and highly analgesic (a local anaesthetic). So when cleaved by a glucosidase enzyme, it becomes active.</p>\n<p>However, the healthy cell is able to further metabolise the cyanide by using another enzyme called Rhodanese and thus renders it harmless &#8211; up to a reasonable limit. The more nitriloside present &#8211; the more Rhodanese is needed, so there are dosage limits applicable. Then there&#8217;s only the Benzaldehyde left to deal with. Benzaldehyde is the reason Laetrile and Amygdalin are renowned for providing pain relief, through a direct effect upon sensory neurons. Secondary pain relief also occurs through tumour reduction, resulting in less inflammation and so on.</p>\n<p>The malignant cell likewise cleaves the molecule with Glucosidase, but doesn&#8217;t express Rhodanese and cannot metabolise the cyanide. Moreover, the malignant cell imports and uses a lot more sugar than healthy cells do, so it takes up a lot more nitriloside. The cyanide kills the malignant cell. Therefore, its bioactivity is highly selective &#8211; much more active against malignant cells.than healthy ones.</p>\n<p>Oral ingestion imposes much more severe restrictions upon dosage, due to enzymatic cleavage and chemical reaction taking place in the gastrointestinal tract. One of the resulting byproducts in the GIT is free cyanide without the benefit of Rhodanese, so the Liver must eventually deal with it. Ammonia is another toxic byproduct in the GIT. In the case of apricot pips, twelve seeds per day is reckoned to be the upper limit of dosage range in an adult. A cup full of apple seeds has allegedly been known to kill.</p>\n<p>Intravenously, these nitrilosides are much safer, provided they have a satisfactory purity. This bypasses the GIT and delivers the molecules intact to the cells, instead of releasing cyanide and ammonia into the blood from the GIT.</p>\n<p>Now, I have stated already that cytotoxic treatments of cancer are not completely satisfactory curative approaches to take. Nitrilosides can work in reducing or perhaps even eliminating tumours, reducing or preventing metastases and in prevention of carcinogenesis. This has been proven. However, when dosage is discontinued, the cancer usually returns, unless other definitive measures aimed at CURE are also undertaken. For this reason, the use of nitrilosides is better made together with other agents &#8211; especially DMSO because it will potentiate the nitriloside even more than the nitriloside does alone and serves a host of other beneficial purposes &#8211; but even then, I still wouldn&#8217;t limit the treatment modality to DMSO-Laetrile exclusively. There are heaps of good adjuvancies, not least of which is Clinoptilolite. I would use as many modalities as possible &#8211; especially those which address the basic essentials I have already mentioned &#8211; nutrition (Budwig and/or Gerson diet, lifestyle, immune support, microbiome support, (detox is effected by Clinoptilolite and so is some considerable measure of immunomodulation), antimicrobial action, pH management and so on.

CANCER CAUSALITY FACTORS:</p>\n<p>Elements or factors that cause, contribute to, or elevate probability of carcinogenesis are many and most of them are listed here:<br />\n.<br />\nRADIATION<br />\nRadiotherapy \u2013 meaning that ironically, cancer therapy using radioisotopes is often carcinogenic;<br />\nElectromagnetic Radiation in certain frequency bands &#8211; especially Short Wave Ultraviolet and X-Ray;<br />\nNeutron or other subatomic particle bombardment (radioactivity);<br />\nAny other propagated high energy disturbances to biochemical pathway equilibrium in the body;<br />\nCHEMICAL<br />\nChemotherapy agents \u2013 especially Nitrogen Mustards;<br />\nOrganic carcinogenic compounds \u2013 Benzene, etc.;<br />\nCarcinogenic mycotoxins \u2013 Aflatoxin, Ochratoxin, etc.;<br />\nInorganic carcinogenic compounds \u2013 Asbestos, Erionite etc.;<br />\nSystemic acidity (pH &lt;7.0);<br />\nFree radicals (excess charged ions) in body tissues;<br />\nHeavy metal cations, such as Mercury, Lead, Platinum and Cadmium;<br />\nGeneral toxicity;<br />\nOxidative stress;<br />\nSome specific enzymes \u2013 Kinases, TGF-Beta, 5-LPO, Cox-1, Cox-2, etc;<br />\nSome specific hormones \u2013 Oestrogen, Cortisol, hCG, bCG etc.;<br />\nSome specific proteins \u2013 ABCB-1, ABCCs, NF-Kappa-Beta, WNT Signalling Proteins, IL20, IL22 &amp; IL24 Interleukins, NADH Oxidase, Oestrogen Receptor, etc.;<br />\nCONSTITUTIONAL<br />\nTelomeres \u2013 limit to the number of healthy daughter cell generations programmed into DNA\u2019s replication);<br />\nUnbalanced biodynamic constitution;<br />\nLow systemic Oxygen levels;<br />\nPoor diet &#8211; mineral deficiency, vitamin deficiency, malnutrition;<br />\nNegative emotion (Cortisol-related anger, fear, hate, stress, depression, etc.);<br />\nInadequate sleep;<br />\nAgeing;<br />\nObesity;<br />\nPhysical injury;<br />\nInflammation;<br />\nConstitutional susceptibility;<br />\nGeneral systemic deterioration;<br />\nImmune System compromise or dysfunction;<br />\nNervous System deterioration or dysfunction;<br />\nLiver failure;<br />\nPancreatic failure;<br />\nOther endocrine/exocrine failure;<br />\nHormonal imbalance;<br />\nPrior constitutional burden \u2013 chronic or acute diseases (AIDS, Diabetes, etc.);<br />\nMICROBIAL<br />\nViral infection;<br />\nBacterial infection;<br />\nFungal infection \u2013 Mould, Yeast infection;<br />\nProtozoic infection;<br />\nGENETIC<br />\nMutation factors (DNA alteration);<br />\nHeredity (inborn genetic factors \u2013 DNA eg: Philadelphia Chromosome);<br />\nForeign genetic material with proliferative or antiapoptogenic coding (DNA, RNA) usually of a viral source;<br />\nAberrant genes &amp; chromosomes, whether inborn or implanted by virus \u2013 MDR-1 Gene, etc.</p>\n<p>All these can be first addressed in a preventive sense by cultivating a healthy lifestyle that avoids exposure to &quot;too much of a bad thing&quot; and maintains a strong constitution. It includes the telomere equation, because you can limit the frequency with which the cells in your body need replacing, thus extending the time it takes for the telomere countdown in the most active cell lines to reach zero. Consider that telomere countdown doesn&#039;t reach zero in all cells or tissues simultaneously. Normally, only those cell lines in continuous replication mode for extended periods may reach this state early in a person\u2019s life and so faulty tissues don\u2019t suddenly appear everywhere in the body at once. Amongst other things, reducing the telomere countdown rate will even minimise a genetic tendency to carcinogenesis.</p>\n<p>An important thing to note is that no single causality factor can be solely responsible for causing cancer. It&#039;s demonstrably so in the case of genetic factors, because were it not so, then even the limited success achieved in treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome leukaemia patients would not be in evidence \u2013 in other words, it should not be possible. Genes, including oncogenes, can be switched on or off.</p>\n<p>Indeed, carcinogenesis is invariably the result of a combination of factors and a series of inducements.</p>\n<p>It begins with risk exposure factors, such as radiation, toxicity, carcinogenic compounds, nutrition deficiencies, Oxygen deficiency, obesity, free radicals and any of certain heavy metals \u2013 Mercury, Cadmium, Lead and so on. Oxygen deficiency is a major one common to ALL cancers and gives rise in turn to partial immune dysfunction, but still requires additional factors to set in, which cause the cells to turn rogue. A major one among these is the phenomenon of immortalising agents, usually imparted by a viral and microbial combination operating in the oxygen-deficient environment.</p>\n<p>These can cause some susceptibility factors to arise, such as increased cell membrane permeability, reduced cell resistance to infection, depressed Immune System function, possible impediments to healthy blood-forming, other kinds of regenerative dysfunction, interference with normal cellular biochemical pathways, introduction of abnormal cellular biochemical pathways induced by foreign genetic material, proteins and/or toxins and what-have-you.</p>\n<p>There are also other innate or chronic susceptibilities that may already be present; or of which there is a progressive onset over time in a deteriorating systemic constitution. The telomeric equation figures in this, though there are many aspects that warrant consideration. Among these are negative emotions, unbalanced constitution, ageing, lack of sleep, general system deterioration, prior disease like AIDS or Diabetes and heredity factors.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5832\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5832\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5832\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 4:46 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5832#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5832\", \"5832\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>The Cell Cycle</p>\n<p>Just like human beings who go through birth, adolescence, reproductive stages, senescence and death, each and every cell in your body also goes through its own life cycle. Scientists are piecing together a huge amount of detail in this field of study, but here is a simplified picture.</p>\n<p>The various stages of a cell&#8217;s life are the G0, G1, S, G2 &amp; M phases. The G0 phase is akin to childhood. This is the quiescent phase in which the cell is immature and not ready to do much of anything. When it is ready to grow up and take part in real life, it has to pass a fidelity test to make sure everything is in order. This test is called a &#8220;checkpoint&#8221;. In normal cells, if the cell does not pass the test, it is not allowed to progress to the next stage. This test prior to entry into G1 stage is called the G1 checkpoint. In many cells the G1 checkpoint seems to be the most important. If a cell passes G1, it will usually complete the cycle and divide. If it does not receive the go-ahead at G1, it will go back to the G0 resting phase. Most cells in an adult human body are in the G0 phase.</p>\n<p>Once the cell has met the standards of the G1 checkpoint, the cell grows in size, making more protein and synthesizing RNA. This is like the period of adolescence in humans, when the cell is getting ready for its adult role of reproduction. After completion of the G1 stage, the cell goes on to the S phase of its life, where &#8220;S&#8221; stands for synthesis. This is when the cell makes fresh DNA, making exact copies of each of its chromosomes. This can be likened to the pregnancy phase, in which the cell is getting ready to give birth to its daughter. But before it is allowed to give birth, it has to go through another period called G2 phase, when it puts the finishing touches and pass/fail another test, the G2 checkpoint to determine if the cell is fit to reproduce. These three stages, G1, S and G2 are together called Interphase.</p>\n<p>If the cell has met the stringent requirements of G1 and G2 checkpoints, it is allowed to proceed to Mitosis, akin to childbirth by this analogy. Cell growth and protein production stop, all other functions take a back seat as the cell focuses all of its energy on the complex job of dividing itself into two similar daughter cells. Mitosis is much shorter than Interphase, it lasts only about one to two hours. There is yet another checkpoint in the middle of mitosis that ensures the cell is ready to complete cell division, with no detectable screw-ups along the way. After completing the process of duplicating itself, the two daughter cells enter G0 resting stage, until they are ready once more to enter the cycle of G1, S, G2 and M. </p>\n<p>The rites of passage of cells from birth to the point where they have earned the right to replicate themselves is pretty strict, with multiple tests and checkpoints along the way. These are necessary hurdles, in order to make sure the genetic information transmitted to the next generation of daughter cells is correct and without errors. The checkpoints are important in weeding out potentially dangerous mutations that can give rise to cancer. With all these safeguards in place, how is it that humans do get cancer? Unfortunately, cancer cells are able to subvert the checks and quality controls and sneak past the checkpoints. For every system of checks and repeat quality control tests that our bodies can invent, there seem to be an equal number of ways of subverting the system. Cancer gets a foothold and establishes itself as a viable entity in our bodies only when it has learned a way of getting around the checkpoints of the cell cycle. This is the stage at which the virus and microbe infection factor plays its role, because these supply programming to the cells to produce higher levels of the Cyclin Dependent Kinases that enable cells to pass the G1 and G2 checkpoints; or reduction of Cyclins, which prevent them doing so. They may also supply other &#8216;systemic disobedience&#8217; factors, such as an imitator of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin, a hormone that selectively suppresses the pregnant mother&#8217;s immune response against her own baby in-utero. This allows the malignant cells to protect themselves from immune response. In cases of drug-resistant cancers, they are responsible for providing the programming by which the cells can produce more export pump proteins to get rid of toxins.</p>\n<p>The Kinases are proteins that control the cell cycle, but most of the time they are in an inactive form. To be active the Kinases must be associated with another type of protein called Cyclins. Hence they are called Cyclin-Dependent Kinases or &#8220;CDKs&#8221;. CDKs control the various checkpoints, they are the gatekeepers that decide whether to pass or fail cells as they go through the various quality control checkpoints in the cell cycle. Cyclins are frequently over-expressed in human cancers (for example, the tell-tale marker for Mantle Cell Leukaemia is over expression of Cyclin D1), lowering the bar for the checkpoints, letting just any malignant cell to pass the checkpoint and on its way to reproduction. Another common feature of cancer cells is decrease in the function of inhibitors of CDKs. Think of these peptides (p16 and p21 are two important genes that encode them) as the supervisors that keep an eye on the CDKs, to make sure they do not drop the standards too low. When the supervisors are asleep on the job, and the CDKs get lax in their standards, malignant cells can pass the checkpoints and proliferate. This is one of the most common features of all cancers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5835\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5835\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5835\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 4:55 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5835#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5835\", \"5835\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Repair And Healing Mechanism</p>\n<p>The presumption where malignancy is concerned (and it is a central one) is that the body&#8217;s repair and healing mechanisms have been caused to go awry. The process of healing and repair may be perceived to comprise four distinct Phases.</p>\n<p>First of these is the Inflammation Phase, being a response to cell deaths via tissue damage or cell redundancy. It involves inflammatory agents such as Nitric Oxide and enzymes such as Cox and LPO.</p>\n<p>The second is the Cleanup Phase, which is an immune system response, whereby white blood cells move in to clean up the debris and make way for new replacement cells.</p>\n<p>The third is the Proliferation Phase, which follows the triggering of inflammation and cleanup, whether by external agents or by the body&#8217;s own regulation mechanisms that involve Nitric Oxide, 5-LPO, Cox-1 or Cox-2 and a cascade of events takes place involving angiogenesis (VEGF-driven) to repair or initiate new blood supplies to an affected region, plus the triggering of Stem Cells (also called Mast Cells, driven by EGF &amp; other factors) into generating replacement cells for the damaged or destroyed tissues. They do this through mitotic replication, by following the cell cycle explained above.</p>\n<p>The fourth is the Differentiation Phase, in which the cells newly generated from stem cells through the Proliferation Phase progressively undergo a differentiating process of maturation into various specialised cells. Dedicated stem cells have no function other than to multiply in order to replace missing, damaged or malfunctioning tissues, though intermediate types exist, which can perform some functions other than multiplying \u2013 fibroblasts and some leucocytes, for example. As they multiply and regulated as they normally are by Cluster of Differentiation markers, Interleukins, WNT cell signalling proteins, CDKs and other agents, they progressively develop more specialised morphologies along a path of differentiation in which they eventually mature into dedicated cells of various specialised functions. Once they become fully differentiated and matured, they cease dividing and take up their required functions in the tissues. By doing all this, they would have progressed through this Differentiation Phase and if not for this, they could never mature and thus never assume their proper roles in the new tissues.</p>\n<p>As already explained, cell cycle CDK regulation plays a significant role in the Proliferative Phase of healing, so failure of its regulation can set the wheels of carcinogenesis in motion.</p>\n<p>But further, as a result of any of the foregoing conditions, the body&#8217;s repair mechanisms are also caused to become faulty in some degree in the Differential Phase of healing, because not only have malignant cells devised means of slipping past the CDK radar, but also inherited the means to defy maturation signals that would otherwise direct them to mature, cease dividing, assume designated roles in the tissues where they are generated and obey systemic regulation signals so that they behave as they should and perform their required functions correctly.</p>\n<p>These foregoing conditions form the basis of a set of risk and susceptibility factors in carcinogenesis and I built the Dynamically Unbalanced Constitution Theory Of Carcinogenesis (DUCTOC) on these. </p>\n<p>Cancer as a biodynamic process is effectively the interference with these vital Proliferative and Differential Phases of the normal healing and repair process, in which multiplying cells pass replication tests when they shouldn\u2019t and then do not mature in this way and so never assume their proper functional roles \u2013 but just go on multiplying, instead. In effect, cancer is an abnormal perpetuation of the Proliferation Phase of healing and failure of the Differentiation Phase to initiate and complete the regeneration process. Certain regulating mechanisms in either the Proliferative Phase or the Differentiation Phase (or both) have been caused to fail in some ways and the preceding passages on the Cell Cycle describe some of the key mechanisms. Having said this, the nature of cancerous cells is still intrinsically different from that of healthy Stem Cells. They are affected to the extent that they may no longer respond satisfactorily to the body&#8217;s normal regulating mechanisms, even if those regulating mechanisms were to be fully restored. They have inherited from the viruses and microbes, by DNA recombination or the production of specific biochemicals, the will and the ability to survive and function much more independently of their healthy parent tissues than healthy tissue cells do. In other words, they have inherited &#8216;selfish&#8217; survival traits of the infectious microbes, themselves. </p>\n<p>These bodily repair mechanisms are orchestrated to some considerable extent by the Immune System, indicating that at least some prior loss of its functionality is already demonstrated by the mere presence of cancer. And so any of these conditions additionally lead to the Immune System&#8217;s functionality being further compromised.</p>\n<p>These are key factors in carcinogenesis.</p>\n<p>All people who have cancer are:</p>\n<p>(a) Functionally oxygen deficient, which may not be a lung or haemoglobin malfunction, but an oxygen transport malfunction across cell membranes. Such a failure may well be connected with poor Calcium utilisation, because this metal is a key element in the process. However, literal Calcium deficiency is actually quite uncommon \u2013 but in order to utilise Calcium correctly, the body also needs Magnesium. Magnesium deficiency is relatively common in developed countries. Systemic toxicity caused by heavy metals like Lead, Platinum, Cadmium and Mercury tends to interfere with trace mineral utilisation, so it can be a contributing oxygen transport interference factor.</p>\n<p>(b) Immunologically compromised, because Oxygen deficiency leads invariably to this condition. The body&#8217;s leucocyte army and its regulating mechanisms need oxygen, like any other cell types, to function optimally. In general, I consider their need for (and consumption of) oxygen is second only to neurons \u2013 the most oxygen-hungry cells in the entire body.</p>\n<p>It is not to say that they are unconditional causality factors, because in truth, they&#8217;re not \u2013 they do not cause cancer in every person in which they are present. However, they ARE critical susceptibility factors and as already stated, they are universally found in every case of malignancy. </p>\n<p>There are NO exceptions to either of these imperatives. They must therefore be regarded as cornerstones in causality theory and a basis upon which prevention and treatment principles are developed. I call these the Oxygen Deficiency Imperative Theorem (ODIT) and the Compromised Immune System Imperative Theorem (CISIT).</p>\n<p>Further to that, there is a very strong parallel between the behaviour of malignant colonies and a gestating foetus. The similarities are startling [see Trophoblast Theory and Immunoplacental Therapy (Dr. Valentin Govallo) in Chapter Six, which looks at Gonadotrophins hCG and bCG].</p>\n<p>Still further yet, my VIMTOCC model (Virally Infected Microbe Theory Of Cancer Causality) has finally evolved to the point where it can plausibly account for causality of ALL cancers. Whether factually so without any exceptions still remains to be established.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5836\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5836\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5836\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 5:02 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5836#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5836\", \"5836\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>The Microbe Phenomenon</p>\n<p>When immunity is compromised as it surely must be when oxygen deficiency is present, opportunistic infection can easily take place, involving invasion of viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms \u2013 or activation and proliferation of previously dormant ones already present in the system. It is not just any microbes, but a cohort of apparently cooperative (or semi-cooperative) pathogens, which collectively exhibit a specific range of biological tendencies. This is a critical stage in which the cancerous condition actually manifests under a regime of microbial causality.</p>\n<p>Microbes \u2013 viruses, bacteria, yeasts and protists account for causality of an undetermined, yet nevertheless large proportion of all cancers. There was a time around the middle of the 20th Century when 100% microbial causality of cancer was more or less universally accepted. It fell from grace, but the reasons are unclear. Despite that, I believe the combined activity of these various microbes actually represents the major proportion of all cancer causalities and further, that all others are characterised by the legacy of previous microbial infections, whereby dormant stem cells inherit the &#8216;knowledge&#8217; of how to turn rogue from microbes, but do not &#8216;activate&#8217; until much later in the lives of the otherwise apparently &#8216;uninfected&#8217; victims. Yet that is in disagreement with existing beliefs among many (but certainly not all) of the present-day biologists and cancer scientists \u2013 whose estimates on viral cancer causality alone vary considerably.</p>\n<p>I noted during May, 2013 that R. Webster Kehr (Cancer Tutor) now also asserts that microbial infection is universal to all cases of carcinogenesis. He did not arrive at his conclusions out of any influence from me, but it is strongly indicated that he did so via the same general stream of research revelations that led me to postulate VIMTOCC. Those relate mostly to Rife&#8217;s electromedical technology of the 1930s to 1950s; the development of an electromedical protocol in 1990 by Doctors Lyman and Kaali and the adoption, use and refinement of it by Bob Beck, in which 100% remission rates have been recorded through the use of both these technologies. All of them pinned causality on microbial activity. If they achieved perfect remission results, even against terminal cancers, then who should question their conclusions? I am in full agreement with Webster that these are the most powerful cancer treatments on Planet Earth. They are unique, in that no other treatment modalities, regardless of whether they may be Ancient Traditional, Alternative or Orthodox in nature, are known to produce such curative results. None!</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the beliefs of Rife, Lyman, Kaali, Beck, Webster, myself and other cancer researchers, those viral estimates I am currently acquainted with are: 10% (Cancer Research UK); 15% (Professor Ian Frazer &amp; Colleagues); and 25% (Raven &amp; Johnson&#8217;s 1989 university biology teaching text). Among these are 100% of cervical cancers, 80% of liver cancers, 5% to 30% of penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oral and pharyngeal cancers and indeterminate proportions of leukaemias, skin, lung, brain and intestinal cancers. </p>\n<p>87% of cervical cancers, in addition to their 100% viral causality, also have demonstrated bacterial involvement, since it is proven that HPV-16 has been shown to infect Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium bacteria, all four of which have shown up in cervical cancer biopsies in that proportion of 87%. Apart from this specific instance, there are no other estimates made public by biologists or orthodox cancer scientists on relative proportions of bacterial, protozoic, yeast or other fungal cancer causality \u2013 at least, none to my current knowledge. However, the greater proportion of stomach cancers are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter Pylori and it can be safely surmised that it is equally true of intestinal cancers \u2013 oesophageal, duodenal, colon, anal and so on \u2013 more so, when one introduces virally infected Enterococcus and other Cocci into the equation as indicated by the cervical cancer biopsies. It indirectly suggests a 4% to 25% bacterial involvement factor of current and active infection in penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oral and pharyngeal cancers in addition to whatever Helicobacter Pylori causes. And that is to say nothing of prior infection legacies.</p>\n<p>Fungal (yeasts, moulds, etc.) cancer causalities remain a contested issue. Most mainstream cancer scientists deny any involvement of yeasts in the phenomenon and effectively quote a 0% estimate. Meanwhile conversely, there are several medical practitioners who have treated cancer patients in their clinics or dedicated cancer hospitals and have quoted 100% yeast involvement, saying that every single patient of theirs with cancer had a Candida yeast presence \u2013 usually Candida Albicans. This species and Candida Parapsilosis are certified producers of carcinogenic toxins. In addition, many infectious moulds \u2013 Aspergillus Flavus, A. Parasiticus &amp; A. Ochraceus and some strains of A. Niger are factually known to produce carcinogenic toxins such as Aflatoxin and Ochratoxin, indicating the likelihood that several other related species do likewise. Many Penicillium, Stachybotris, Microsporum, Trichophyton and probably other genera of moulds also produce carcinogens. There are no estimates on Aspergillus cancer causalities, nor indications of just how infectious these funghi are. It has been indicated that Aspergillus infection is by spores inhaled into the lungs. There, in the Alveoli, they grow into funghi, form tumours called Aspergillomas and also migrate via the blood to just about anywhere else in the body. Aflatoxin is one of the most potent carcinogens known to medical science. It was during 2011, I was able to verify Candida Albicans and Candida Parapsilosis do in fact produce carcinogenic toxins. That now adds direct and active carcinogenesis to their possible, or even probable contributory roles by providing anaerobic fermentation of sugars to produce energy; and also their facilitating cellular penetration by viruses and bacteria.</p>\n<p>Giving account for these microbially caused cancers is the model I call Virally Infected Microbe Theory Of Cancer Causality (VIMTOCC).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5837\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5837\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5837\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 5:09 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5837#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5837\", \"5837\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Tissues With High Rates Of Redundancy</p>\n<p>The most common cancers occur in epithelial, endothelial, mesothelial, endocrine, exocrine and bloodforming tissue types, partly due to the short life expectancy of healthy cells in such tissues and the consequently high rate of ongoing replacement that is necessary to maintain those tissues in good order; and partly due to their higher-than-usual degree of exposure to pathogens or carcinogens than most other tissue types. These two main factors combined result in a much higher risk that the healing regulation processes can more easily fail in membranous, endocrine, exocrine and bloodforming tissue (immune system) types; and thereby result in carcinogenesis in any glands, membranes or leucocytes \u2013 lungs, blood &amp; lymph vessels, intestines and so on \u2013 or indeed in any tissues with a high proportion of active stem cells.</p>\n<p>This in turn leads to a further cascade of events, mainly at the cellular level. They include the production of abnormally high levels of certain aberrant bioregulatory or modulatory proteins, enzymes and hormones; or the inhibition of others needed for healthy metabolism and regulation. They may be triggered in the microorganisms by virii, or they may be triggered in the cells by either virii or various other microorganisms. Among them are undifferentiating agents or differentiation inhibitors, which cause cells to regress into (or perpetually remain in) abnormal &#8220;stem cell states&#8221;, where they continue multiplying instead of naturally progressing towards maturation. These invading microbes are also responsible for apoptosis mediation inhibitors that prevent actions that normally induce a cell to die when it is no longer satisfactorily functional; plus still others that inhibit the Immune System from getting rid of them.</p>\n<p>The pathway of carcinogenesis may progress through pre-cancerous phases via formation of &#8220;noncancerous&#8221; or &#8220;precancerous&#8221; tumours or growths, such as moles, warts, papillomas or other hyperplastic and neoplastic abnormalities. In any case, the tissue maintenance and repair system is functionally degraded in at least some degree when this occurs. Cells created to replace damaged or redundant ones cease to differentiate in the correct manner. Instead, they continue to multiply and ultimately fail to mature properly, so they cannot assume their properly assigned roles in the tissues. If they remain clustered together to form a distinct and aberrant growth, they are often referred to as \u201cneoplasms\u201d.</p>\n<p>Driving Forces Of Disrupted Biogenic Regulation Pathways</p>\n<p>Substitution of genetic material with that from viruses by the virii themselves occurs in the infected microorganisms and also in the host cells, further driving the cascade of abnormal biochemical reaction pathways and accelerating the process of cellular mutation. This mutation may depend somewhat on whether the viral genetic material is DNA or RNA. Foreign DNA and RNA interpose the biochemical pathways of a living cell at different stages in those biochemical processes \u2013 DNA pretty much directly at the genetic level (it is recombinant and therefore definitely mutagenic), while RNA does so at the transmission of information level, becoming responsible for encoding aberrant proteins and so on as if there were some genetic mutation present, but not necessarily stemming from nuclear mutation, itself; nor necessarily leading to it.</p>\n<p>This in turn presupposes, in the case of a legacy microbial infection being the cause of carcinogenesis, that the culprit must have been Recombinant DNA \u2013 not RNA, nor residual carginogenic chemicals.</p>\n<p>Energy and nutrition requirements in the affected cells increase dramatically as they enter into a perpetual cycle of mitosis (cell division), because it requires more resources to sustain the increased metabolic activity of a malignant cell. Bacterial or yeast interference with the Krebs Cycle may occur also and whether or not this occurs, anaerobic respiration becomes the major process by which ATP and/or other energy carriers are created to power the cell replication process.</p>\n<p>The demand is possibly met by yeasts or some types of bacteria, since the Mitochondria may no longer meet the energy demand alone.</p>\n<p>Glucose and Insulin demand increases much more drastically to fuel this energy requirement, since although anaerobic glycolysis is conveniently faster, it is also about 19 times less efficient than aerobic metabolism of sugars. The infected cells are forced to generate far more glucose and insulin receptors than is normal in healthy cells, in order to import the required amounts of fuel and other materials. The byproduct of this anaerobic glycolysis is lactic acid, which becomes a toxic factor. The poorer efficiency means that production of lactic acid and probably other toxic byproducts is vastly increased.</p>\n<p>These cells typically have much more permeable membranes than healthy cells \u2013 they are described as being &#8220;leaky&#8221;. At least some of that permeability may be attributable to the cells multiplying rabidly in a nutritionally deficient environment, whereby they are unable to generate fully formed membranes and other substructures (perhaps by skimping on the length of the lipid chains in the membrane bilayers and/or other shortcuts). Normally, such cells would die of their own accord through internal apoptosis mediation or systemic regulation, but with immortalisation agents like excessive CDKs being present or with suppressors of p16, p21 and other related genes, they don&#8217;t necessarily die, at all. In some other cases, they may have been made leaky by enzymes causing proteolysis or lipolysis (destruction of proteins or lipids in cell membranes), such as those produced by Yeasts. They may also simply be using short cuts to obtain nutritional resources and discharge wastes more easily.</p>\n<p>However, bacteria produce an array of additional substances as mentioned, such as anti-apoptogens (sometimes called &#8220;immortalising agents&#8221;) and masking proteins or immuno-downregulators such as Chorionic Gonadotrophins to inhibit immune response; angiogenesis agents that stimulate blood vessel growth to feed growing tumours; and even in some cases, specialised export pump proteins to facilitate drug resistance; plus other toxins as byproducts of their own metabolisms \u2013 or they trigger the victim tissue cells to produce them. These even include defences designed to kill attacking leucocytes, such as T-reg Cells, a mutant cancerous form of T-Cell Leucocyte. This nasty little bugger resides in tumours and directly attacks healthy leucocytes and destroys them if they enter the tumours in an attempt to fight the cancer. In other words, T-Cells can be hijacked to provide tumours with aggressive defence against normal immune response. This is an apparent emulation of foetal trophoblast behaviour. Trophoblasts are foetal cells that protect the foetus from its own mother\u2019s immune response.</p>\n<p>Some types of infected cells may be driven to express increased amounts of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, again for defence against immune response. Note that this can be a very DANGEROUS hormone, yet HCG is becoming much more freely used in weight loss regimes. Certain coccal bacteria are also known to produce their own imitation of hCG, which I call bCG. Most cancer cells are also triggered into producing increased amounts of differentiation mediators such as TGF-\uf062; which mediate differentiation in healthy cells, but inhibit differentiation in cancerous cells; and which also cause accelerated development of blood vessels to increase nutrient supply. Other proteins are produced, whether by cancerous host cells or their infecting bacteria, such as NF-Kappa-Beta. It&#8217;s a mediator of all sorts of unhealthy functions ranging from the causing of Cachexia, to encoding of P-Glycoproteins for various transport functions and especially toxin efflux pump proteins to give the cells resistance against cytotoxic drugs (as well as to save them from being poisoned in their own lactic acid mire).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5838\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5838\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5838\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 5:19 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5838#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5838\", \"5838\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Resistant &amp; Unresponsive Cancers</p>\n<p>Resistance and unresponsiveness to treatment on the parts of various cancers are not necessarily the same thing. Resistance to drugs is characterised by certain types of cancer wherein the cells have equipped themselves with dedicated transport proteins in their exterior membranes called Efflux Pumps. The ABCB-1 protein is the classic example. Knowing this predetermines that a set of treatment agents active against Mitochondrial Complex I will be the optimal approach \u2013 whether Acetogenins, Styryl Lactones, Berberine, Rotenoids or other ATP inhibitive agents. This is because inhibition of ATP production is the best way to defeat malignant biochemical processes characterised by efflux pumps, because they are so highly energy-intensive. These Mitochondrial Complex I Inhibitors generally also cause Mitochondria to release Caspase enzymes, which are potent apoptosis mediators.</p>\n<p>Unresponsive cancers may not necessarily be so characterised and may instead be merely unresponsive to certain particular anticarcinomic agents because they are tolerant of them; and the agents cannot interfere with their respective biochemistries. It may be due to absence of the appropriate chemical receptors and this would be the result of genetic mutation. Consider that mutation is a characteristic of cancer, whereby almost infinite variation in cellular biochemistry of the resulting generations of daughter cells becomes possible. Some are simply not viable and die. Some inherit certain sets of biochemical receptors and chemical pathways for accomplishing metabolic functions, yet not others. They may respond to certain anticarcinomic agents, yet not others. It\u2019s one of the mechanisms of evolution, even in relatively healthy biology, but is radically accelerated in cancer to more nearly approach that of microbes themselves. Basically, the malignant biology in its own way of random experimentation, is trying to seek out a way to survive, very much after the same fashion as microbes. Healthy specialised cells are unselfish, cooperative and willingly die if that is for the greater good. Malignant cells do not communicate in the same ways with each other, are poorly cooperative and show a stronger individual tendency to selfishly survive. In this sense, they display behaviours more consistent with independent primitive organisms such as bacteria, yeasts and protozoa. When one connects and illuminates this observation with the knowledge of bacterial or viral genetic material being inserted into malignant cells via infection, each phenomenon explains the other and it all makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it is to be expected that not every cancer, even among those presumed to be of the same type, can be cured through using the same agent or combination of agents, no matter how good it may generally be overall. When resistance or unresponsiveness is encountered in cancer treatment, one must be prepared to apply different treatments using different agents. If one is familiar with the precise mutation and its particular characteristics, that offers an advantage in the matter of treatment choice, but with almost infinite variety, the majority are not known and their inherited chemistries are not understood in complete detail.</p>\n<p>One size does not fit all and one treatment does not cure all. Even if using something like Rife technology, it is usually necessary to apply a range of specific frequencies, instead of just one.</p>\n<p>So one begins with the application of basic treatment principles and then expands upon those into various combinations and permutations, guided as much as possible by the known biological factors, but where it becomes necessary, into the realm of experimentation. Doing so is common in all forms of medicine, whether mainstream or alternative and were it not for that, there would be no medical advancement. So whether experimentation is a good or a bad thing depends upon the motive driving it and the manner in which it is conducted.</p>\n<p>When venturing into such terra incognita, there are certain rules of safety that must be observed under the general principle: \u201cDo No Harm\u201d.</p>\n<p>Stem cells are also affected in carcinogenesis to become CSCs (Cancer Stem Cells), in the way I have presumed under VIMTOCC. And although they constitute only a small proportion of the population in normal circumstances, they are much more highly undifferentiated than other cell types, so they can evolve to meet certain survival needs more quickly and easily than other cells. I believe the more common non-resistant cancer cells would first need to retro-differentiate before being able to re-differentiate in such specific ways to be capable of expressing large numbers of efflux pumps. So I believe CSCs are therefore the major progenitors of the MDRCs (Multi-Drug-Resistant Cells) that are so difficult to eradicate and are ultimately responsible for a large proportion of cancer treatment failures and resulting deaths.</p>\n<p>When the usual drugs used against cancer have reduced the cancer cell population, sometimes almost to nil (but not quite), the great majority of surviving cells are of this drug-resistant kind. They proliferate rapidly (because they&#8217;re stem cells of a sort) and when developed into MDRCs, don&#8217;t respond to conventional treatment. Together with the infecting microbes and many side effects induced by chemotherapy, they eventually kill the victim. Even when these cells are fully eradicated, the surviving virii and other microorganisms, mutant or viral genetic material, plus other proteins and hormones, together with systemic toxicity and so on, can still trigger perfectly healthy stem cells into becoming CSCs and possibly MDRCs in turn; and so renew the vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>Preventing this compels eradication of infectious microbes.</p>\n<p>MDRCs are characterised by the presence of huge numbers of P-glycoprotein ABCB-1 efflux pump molecules in their membranes, plus others perhaps, such as ABCCs \u2013 it\u2019s not just efflux pumps in the plasma membranes, but intracellular transport molecules such as ABCGs, too; with which they are able to rapidly expel toxic waste and cancer drugs. The operation of these transporters and efflux pumps requires enormous amounts of energy in the form of ATP \u2013 about 200 times more than a healthy cell, placing even greater demand upon the processes that synthesise ATP. And if all that ATP is being produced anaerobically, then it is also requiring 19 times as much Glucose to avail the same quantity of ATP. Being able to expel toxins is the MDRC&#8217;s strength, but comes at an enormous cost \u2013 requiring such huge amounts of energy to function is its inherent weakness.</p>\n<p>I also learned circa 6th March 2010 that there is a very important protein called NF-Kappa-Beta, which mediates a lot of abnormal biochemical activities in cancer cells; plus a few lesser ones and especially so in MDRCs. It apparently mediates production of the efflux pumps in resistant cells and amongst several other unsavoury biochemical activities, it is even responsible for cachexia, since it mediates muscle protein destruction, in concert with that Liver enzyme in a process called Gluconeogenesis \u2013 the generation of new Glucose, presumably from non-saccharide substances. What is not yet known is which entities are actually responsible for creation of the NF-Kappa-Beta protein. Do viruses encode this substance in bacteria, or in human cells, or both? What of the efflux pump it mediates production of? Is it the P-gp ABCB-1 efflux pump, or are there still others \u2013 perhaps ABCB-2 and so on, or the related ABCC and ABCG proteins? What relationship, if any, is there with MDR-1 Gene that is said to encode P-gp ABCB-1; and is the MDR-1 Gene native to the human cell genome, or is it a pathogenic implant from virus or bacteria? The latter seems more than just highly likely in my view, but obviously, I still have gaps to fill.</p>\n<p>It is also suspected that infecting bacteria (and possibly other microbes such as yeasts and protozoa) develop resistance via similar efflux pump mechanisms to those of MDRCs. A percentage of these microbes become what I call MDRMs [Multi-Drug-Resistant Microbes \u2013 MDRB (bacteria); MDRYs (yeast); or MDRP (protozoa)]. The worst bacterial examples currently known are MRSA and VRSA, respectively the Methycillin Resistant strain and Vancomycin Resistant strain of Staphylococcus Aureus \u2013 the notorious Golden Staph. These strains produce prodigious quantities of Anthoxanthin, a very potent antioxidant Carotenoid, which gives Golden Staph its characteristic colour and clearly indicates that all strains of this bug are resistant in some degree. They use it to neutralise Oxygen radicals and particularly those released by Hydrogen Peroxide, the main chemical weapon produced by Granulocytes to kill them. However, the strains differ in what particular drugs they are best able to resist, which indicates that they may use other secondary means of resistance, too. As of early 2012, I have been able to verify that these bacteria do indeed use efflux pumps, so Anthoxanthin is not their only means of drug resistance. It also adds more weight to the theory that MDRCs probably inherit this efflux pump encoding capability from viruses and bacteria.</p>\n<p>The presumption where microbe eradication is concerned, is that as the non-resistant microbes are eradicated through treatment with bactericides, fungicides and so on, the proportion of MDRMs in the overall microbial population increases to make the successful elimination of the cancer more difficult, as is the case with MDRCs among cancer cells. I therefore hypothesise this to be a significant aspect of the refractory cancer phenomenon that is additional to the MDRC problem. Another possible explanation exists for drug resistance in microbes \u2013 they may actually develop chemical processes within themselves to metabolise toxins. However, I see this as being far less likely, as it may require the development of a separate processing pathway involving whole hosts of enzymes and other agents for each particular class of toxin. This has to be more of an evolutionary process that might have required millions of years, were it not that nowadays on Earth, there is probably an abundance of variegated strains of virus already abroad and of which a proportion is simply bound to carry suitable genetic programming. Nevertheless, I hypothesise it should still take some time for a new bacterial strain to emerge and thrive by inheriting new viral DNA like this. In this hypothetical evolution of microbes that specialise in processing a particular type of toxin, if the toxin is significantly different, you can be fairly sure the microbe is a different species or at least a different strain. Could the role lie more in the domain of Archaea than Bacteria? By contrast, efflux pump development is far easier because it merely involves selective adaptation and deployment of a specific set of transport proteins.</p>\n<p> Whatever phenomenon facilitates microbial drug resistance, their certified involvement in carcinogenesis is the reason that the microbes must also be eradicated and the entire system must be normalised to a healthy, balanced state \u2013 otherwise, there can be no satisfactory result. The fact that they can become resistant to certain drugs simply implies that the means to do so must be equal to that more difficult purpose of eradication. In following parts of Cancer&#8217;s Answers, those means to deal successfully with MDRCs and MDRMs are identified and discussed in greater detail. It will surprise you when you discover just how many natural agents elucidated in the Cancer\u2019s Answers databases are actually effective against MRSA, VRSA and other resistant bugs. You do not need Cillins or Mycins; and Cillins cannot beat MRSA, nor Mycins beat VRSA, yet certain natural agents such as Acetogenins, Styryl Lactones, Berberine and Rotenoids definitely can. Many different botanical species produce bactericidal agents that are proven effective against resistant strains and in particular, MRSA. Matico (the Soldier\u2019s Herb), and the annonaceous plants such as North American Paw Paw, Graviola and Custard Apple are among these. So are Goldthread, Goldenseal, Cork Trees and Barberry, to name a few of the plants that express Berberine. </p>\n<p>Mutation rates are generally accelerated through several of these various carcinogenic processes, resulting either through substituted gene replication from viruses; or from faulty gene replication in the unhealthy tissue environment \u2013 especially the lactose-rich and bacteriotoxin-rich (mycotoxin-rich) environment within the cytoplasm of the cells, themselves. These cells, in the scheme of their apparent immortalisation, also seem to become immune in at least some degree to attrition due to Telomere loss. They can lose all the Telomeres and still remain viable \u2013 a fact that has scientists dedicated to studying longevity VERY interested. Chromosome breaks (or chromosome losses) occur at vastly greater rates than in healthy tissue replenishment or growth processes. One of the reasons is that the mitosis checkpoint system no longer operates properly in malignant cells. In spite of the faulty apoptosis signalling mechanisms that fail to tell cells to commit suicide when they&#8217;re too mutated to be viable, there is nevertheless a high attrition rate. Large numbers of cancer cells die regardless, due to non-viability caused by critical DNA transcription errors, or by toxification, or starvation within the cores of hard tumours, as well as through other factors. The deaths release substances from their cytoplasms in increasing amounts that become dangerously and even lethally toxic when there are enough of them, including Lactic Acids, Phosphates and Potassium.</p>\n<p>Excessive release of Phosphates and Potassium embodies the deadly phenomenon known as TLS (Tumour Lysis Syndrome).</p>\n<p>Cachexia arising from the production of a certain liver enzyme and mediators like NF-Kappa-Beta further compound that toxicity problem through the destruction of healthy tissues. More Potassium and more Phosphates are released into the lymph and vascular system to heighten the danger even more. It also includes the anti-apoptogenic, anti-differentiation and anti-immune compounds already mentioned. The cascade effect from this is a depletion of Calcium, resulting in dangerous reduction of transmembrane Oxygen transport in healthy cells, because the Calcium is precipitated out of the Lymph and blood as Calcium Phosphate. This Calcium depletion works to subvert more cells to the cancerous condition, beginning when they are forced to metabolise anaerobically and then start producing lactic acid, themselves; but this process is of course compounded by the host of other carginogenic elements present, including those of microbes and their pathogenic activities. Calcium Phosphate also blocks arteries and wrecks the kidneys, because it is very poorly soluble and easily forms plaque deposits in function-critical places. The Potassium, at high enough levels in the Lymph, is quite simply lethal. This toxic condition involving unbalanced levels of Calcium, Potassium and Phosphates is called Tumour Lysis Syndrome, as I have already mentioned. It can be very, very deadly. Several mainstream chemotherapy drugs \u2013 Flavopiridol, some MABs and other types are notorious for causing TLS.</p>\n<p>There may be some natural cytotoxic agents, which if overused, can do likewise. However, in alternative medicine, naturopathic doctors are much more cautious about resorting to cytotoxic methods in the treatment of cancer. I have found that the great majority base their treatment philosophy on approaching the restoration of the biodynamic balance and tend to do so by taking multiple approaches. In this way, they intervene in a much broader spectrum of the physiological pathways associated with carcinogenesis and deal with each specific pathway somewhat less aggressively. In other words, they seek balance and follow the correct medical paradigm, unlike orthodox oncologists. Therefore, the risk of TLS rarely becomes an issue in alternative cancer medicine, if ever.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5839\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5839\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5839\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 5:38 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5839#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5839\", \"5839\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Faulty Cell Signal Transduction</p>\n<p>WNT cell signalling molecules play a role by binding to signal receptors on the membranes of malignant cells to close their intercellular signal mechanisms up into wholly autonomous feedback loops, so that the malignant cells signal to themselves and do not respond to externally originated signalling proteins or perhaps even hormones (many of which are proteins, anyway). This of course reduces or eliminates the normal tendency to cooperate with other cells in the manner that healthy cells do. In turn, the phenomenon predetermines what types of Interleukin cell signal mediators will play active roles in signal transduction between cells.  </p>\n<p>The mutation rates also generate motile cancer cells \u2013 ones that migrate to other tissues and establish new tumour colonies. The migratory phenomenon may be driven by generation of faulty intercellular binding proteins and specialist saccharides by which cells recognise each other, communicate and congregate to form tissues and is probably further compounded by the WNT self-signalling phenomenon. They are known as Cluster Of Differentiation markers and when these no longer match the CD markers characterising the other cancer cells among which they were generated, those cells with the new CD markers become motile and actually set out to find their own kind by migrating elsewhere. Their ongoing process of mitosis is what creates more of their own kind and eventually as they bind together in separate colonies like this, they cease to roam and become new static growths of malignant tissue. This migratory process is called Metastasis and those secondary tumours established in this way are called Metastases. When cancer reaches this stage of development, it is described as Metastatic, or Stage IV. These colonies have a stronger tendency to generate similarly mutated cells than their parent tumours, which once again don&#8217;t recognise their progenitors as compatible tissues, so they in turn become motile and the whole process of metastasis repeats at accelerated rates of incidence. The metastatic phenomenon is exponential in nature, operating literally on a binary exponential function of acceleration, so the whole process snowballs and can rapidly become fatal.</p>\n<p>Further, toxin efflux saturates the lymph in surrounding tissues, weakening healthy neighbouring cells. Since they are also starved in some considerable degree of the oxygen, glucose and insulin they need to function normally by competition from cancer cells and the loss by precipitation of Calcium, so they commence respiring anaerobically, as cells normally do when there is insufficient oxygen present to fully support the Krebs Cycle. Athletes commonly experience anaerobic respiration at the outer limits of their physical performance, but that is relatively harmless in a healthy system unless too much of it builds up in the myocardium (heart muscle). However, in a system hosting ravenous and rabidly multiplying malignant cells, the hypoxic condition becomes chronic for these erstwhile healthy cells and they can be subverted to the cancerous condition by the coincident host of carcinogenic agents inherited from microbes. The likelihood of cells becoming subverted by closely neighbouring malignant tissues is thus further increased by the presence in the Lymph of these various immortalising and other aberrant agents produced and released by the malignant cells, or pathogens or both; especially as they die in increasing numbers and release them wholesale into the Lymph.</p>\n<p>Virii and other microbes are also released from infected cells, both living and dead. The live ones actively seek out new host cells. Increasingly, healthy cells nearby become susceptible to cancer through this toxic and microbial presence. In exponentially increasing numbers, they become cancerous, themselves, although I consider that they remain as &#8220;Sensitive Cells&#8221; and do not evolve into MDRCs, unless they happen to be stem cells that become infected in this way. But of course, where stem cells are present, they, too can become infected or otherwise subverted and so become CSCs; which can then in turn become resistant MDRCs. MDRCs are difficult to treat without the right kinds of agents, but CSCs can be more so, because of their capacity to evolve rapidly, in order to survive in a changing biochemical environment. To give you some idea, they can actually assume a low energy state, which other cancer cells presumably cannot. This can enable them to survive against MDRC agents such as Acetogenins. Ah, but the good news is that in the low energy state, they cannot survive against certain other apoptogenic or cytotoxic agents. They can either evolve into MDRCs, or into LECSCs (Low Energy Cancer Stem Cells), but they can&#8217;t be both at the same time.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Having and operating efflux pump proteins to facilitate drug resistance is a function that has inescapably high energy requirements, particularly in the form or ATP. Low and high energy states in malignant cells are not mutually compatible. Either you have a high energy cancer cell, or you have a low energy cancer cell. You cannot have a cell which is in both states at the same time. So what appears to happen instead is that the malignant stem cell population generates both of these subtypes, possibly in more or less equal proportions \u2013 MCF-7/wt is one such line of CSC that can apparently generate a subtype (MCF-7/let) one could call a LECSC, as well as the MCF-7/mdr (MDRC) such as MCF-7/adr (Adriamicin resistant type). This seems to be what is observed by scientists in Human Adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) tissues, so I presume it also occurs in other malignant tissue types. One may perceive the LECSC as a more-or-less dormant type that is not actively proliferating, much as you find most healthy stem cells remain dormant until they are signalled to become active.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5840\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5840\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5840\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 5:44 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5840#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5840\", \"5840\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Cachexia, Hijacked Cell Cycle Regulation &amp; Systemic Toxification</p>\n<p>The onset of an entropic tissue condition known as Cachexia begins when the first malignant cells appear in the tissues. This appears to be a response to the presence of various substances generated by malignant cells or carcinogenic microbes, whereby the Liver is induced to produce an enzyme that deconstructs cells in the body \u2013 especially by proteolysis (breaking down proteins). These are presumed to circulate freely and break proteins apart throughout the body. The resulting peptides or aminos enter the bloodstream and eventually reach the Liver. There, they are reprocessed to produce more Glucose \u2013 a process called Gluconeogenesis \u2013 and the new Glucose returns to the circulation to eventually feed the cells. The Proteolysis Inducing Factor (PIF) that is produced in tumours is a major culprit. NF-Kappa-Beta is also said to mediate production of a cachexic enzyme and NF-K-\uf062 is typically produced by malignant cells. The mechanisms are said to be not well understood in medicine even still, but TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, PIF and Cytokines are thought to be instrumental in the manifestation of Cachexia. High blood plasma levels of Ghrelin, a 28-amino-acid peptide that acts as a hormone and stimulates hunger, are found in cachexic cancer patients and in anorexic people. Precisely how Ghrelin figures in Cachexia or Anorexia is something I have not yet studied. In its advanced form, Cachexia is dangerous to the point of being lethal and is directly responsible for a great many cancer deaths \u2013 allegedly one in every three cancer victims.</p>\n<p>The Upshot Of It All</p>\n<p>When a person\u2019s Immune System is unable to cope with a normal incidence of mutant cells; or more definitively, it loses its ability to regulate the Differential Phase of tissue repair and when other conditions associated with cancer are also present to induce this condition of differential regulation failure (such as chemical carcinogens, tissue acidity, anoxia and those particular microbial infections), they start to multiply uncontrollably and then interfere with the body\u2019s normal functions. This happens according to my reckoning through two general mechanisms.</p>\n<p>One is triggering the cells into uncontrolled mitotic cycles, in which they rapidly divide as they strive to &#8220;evolve themselves&#8221; to better suit the existing environmental conditions that are set up by the infecting microorganisms and their virii; or by other causes. This evolution is more or less akin to cellular differentiation, but the biochemical governing factors are abnormal and for most of the cells (the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; ones), that capacity to evolve is still rather limited \u2013 there can be enormous attrition rates among them. Those microbes, for the greater part, also provide the chemical mechanisms for sustaining cellular undifferentiation, perpetual mitotic cycles, immortalisation and immune response inhibition. It is made worse by that response to these conditions by the Liver, which produces the proteolytic enzyme that results in Cachexia. That may be a response to PIF, or sensing in some way that the Glycogen and fat reserves are all gone and the sugar levels are still too low to sustain ongoing metabolic functions, or perhaps that cellular overgrowths are happening and it tries to do its bit to normalise the situation. But Gluconeogenesis actually contributes to feeding the malignancy and a vicious cycle is entered. It is further made worse by NF-Kappa-Beta, which also mediates Cachexic processes. Malignant cells typically produce substances of this type. And it is made worse by WNT and Interleukin cell surface signalling proteins of certain types which create closed self-signalling loops in which the malignant cells are telling themselves not to suicide and instead to continue multiplying; while at the same time becoming unresponsive to signalling from other cells. In effect, they lose the ability to cooperate normally with other cells.</p>\n<p>The other mechanism is my own surmise, based on the following premise.</p>\n<p>It occurs by cancer cells changing the living conditions of the healthy cells in the most closely surrounding tissues, which are robbed of the lion&#8217;s share of available Glucose and increasingly over time, of Calcium (by phosphorylation) and therefore Oxygen, too. They are induced to metabolise anaerobically, but in addition, the local Lymph is acidified (or toxified) to such an extent that those neighbouring cells suffer weakening of their membranes and interference to their normal metabolic processes. This induces them to become infected more easily by the offending microbes and since it\u2019s in an increasingly oxygen-deficient environment, it is one that is naturally conducive to further carcinogenesis. Anaerobic microbes are able to thrive and healthy cells cease to be healthy when there is a persistent shortage of Oxygen. Thus, the cancerous condition subverts increasing numbers of healthy cells as well as proliferation via rapid multiplication of the already unhealthy, cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>Unchecked, the whole condition of the disease ultimately leads to death through physical tissue damage, poisoning and other factors, which include Cachexia. It is often horribly painful. A frequent result among terminally ill cancer patients is that they enter into palliative care hospices, where the pain is treated with opiates such as Morphine, instead of the cancer being treated. As often as not, the anaesthesia kills the patient before the cancer does, as was the case with my father. And believe it or not, this form of auto-euthanasia by self-administered drip is commonplace in developed countries, even where euthanasia is otherwise illegal!</p>\n<p>The whole scenario naturally shows that when a person&#8217;s Immune System is functioning at optimum and the body environment is in balance, cancer should not occur, regardless of any other contributing factors, such as carcinogens, genetic predisposition, pathogenic infection and so on. This clearly indicates that in most cases if not all cases, the right treatments can just as readily reverse carcinogenesis. Any cell replication process invariably produces a nominal percentage of mutant cells, because DNA replication is an immensely complex process and occasionally MUST go wrong with a few cells. It is normal and can even conceivably help to drive the body\u2019s adaptive processes by producing subtle variations in certain specialised cell types. Either the Immune System just as normally copes with the dysfunctional ones, unless it&#8217;s functionally deficient or overburdened, itself; or apoptosis catches up with the whacko cells, eventually. This should usually happen during the G1 and G2 checkpoint phases of the Cell Cycle, but of course, that regulation process is off the rails in the case of cancer, due to the overproduction of CDKs and/or the underproduction of its inhibitors per the Immune System&#8217;s p16 and p21 Genes.</p>\n<p>Keeping tissue oxygenation optimal and the Immune System as highly functional as possible is therefore of paramount importance.</p>\n<p>Of course, the presence of carcinogens serves to upset the balance in the bodily environment. It\u2019s been stated by several experts that carcinogens facilitate easier penetration of the protective cell membranes by those microbes responsible for interrupting the Krebs Cycle; OR, according to non-microbial theories, that the carcinogens directly interfere with Oxygen transport across the cell membranes to trigger anaerobic respiration. To these, I can add another process of facilitating penetration by carcinogenic microbes. Various funghi or yeasts and also parasitic protozoa use potent enzymes that digest cellular matter and can thus make it very easy for bacteria and virii to enter cell interiors: for example, Malarial protozoa actually penetrate into cell interiors and can certainly carry bacteria and viruses with them; but in all cases known to me, it takes more than any such elements in isolation to trigger large-scale carcinogenesis.</p>\n<p>There are other conditions required and other steps involved, as already indicated.</p>\n<p>Carcinogenesis is not a simple process.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5842\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5842\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5842\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 6:04 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5842#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5842\", \"5842\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>CHAPTER TWO: HICS \u2013 HOLISTICALLY INTEGRATED CANCER STRATEGY</p>\n<p>A. EVOLUTION OF THEORY AND TREATMENT PHILOSOPHY</p>\n<p>There have been various theories over the years regarding the exact nature of cancer cells and what causes them to generate. The Trophoblastic Theory and Pleomorphic Microbe Theory are two examples and these have been discussed either in Chapter One or elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It is likewise with treatment philosophies, strategies and technologies. In some cases, they would have stemmed from those respective theories, but in others, unexpected results in medical treatment and even other environments have instead prompted evolution of the theories to suitably account for observed phenomena. Some have shown merit, but a great many have not, usually as a result of being founded upon erroneous premises. Shortcomings or errors of these types may associate with any of the various streams of medical practice \u2013 mainstream, traditional OR alternative.</p>\n<p> Red herrings do appear to have disseminated into the community to promote ignorance and maintain public expectation of poor curative results. There have been others merely cooked up by some moron whose mind is away on another planet; or by an equally brain-dead religious nut; or by a creative and very entrepreneurial type, who happens to be short of a scruple or three and smells a money spinner. The advent of the Internet has expanded the incidence of any or all of these, but on balance, I would venture to say it has mainly been for the better. One of the biggest benefits in this respect is the radical difference the Internet has made to the availability and accessibility of factual scientific data and research material. It is almost matched by the rate of growth in the body of biological knowledge in recent decades, particularly with respect to DNA and cellular biochemistry pathways. In is inevitable these developments will ultimately lead to an eventual conquest of cancer and that conquest will be total. The problem is that commercial forces still exist, which are an impediment to this utopian condition becoming a reality anytime soon. The same problem is exacerbated by persistent efforts pharmaceutical corporations make to worsen the general health of the global populace via faulty, contaminated, doctored or substandard drugs that (a) do not cure; and (b) create additional diseases. Via both of these contrivances and coupled also with control and manipulation of regulating authorities, they exercise monopolistic or oligopolistic powers to maximise profits.</p>\n<p>However, there are some exceedingly powerful ancient secrets dating back over 5,000 years and possibly as far back as 12,000 years that still survive in various forms through the teachings of some Tibetan monasteries, the Tantra, Ayur Veda and manuscripts of the Essenes in the Middle East, especially those of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Wadi Qumran. These take the form more of an &#8220;understanding&#8221; of the human condition from a spiritual perspective and the strategies and technologies are natural and spiritualistic (religio-psionic). This viewpoint may be seen by medical people of an \u201cempirical\u201d outlook to be inherently faulty, but because spirituality is undoubtedly a powerful force in human health, it is not necessarily true, at all. A \u201cfaulty medical rationale\u201d can still work quite powerfully well and for purely practical purposes, if it works, it should be considered quite valid enough.</p>\n<p>Some other theories and treatments date to the very early 20th Century and of these, a few are surprisingly sound, if rather basic. Throughout the latter two-thirds of the 20th Century, some extremely effective treatments were discovered or devised, along with a variety of theories about causality, but few of these found their way into the medical mainstream, while one that did was ultimately removed from orthodox practice in the early 1940s. That was Electromedicine, especially in the form of George Lakhovski&#8217;s Multi-Wave Oscillators and Royal Raymond Rife&#8217;s machines. </p>\n<p>Currently, theory on cancer causality pretty much evolves in three streams.</p>\n<p>One is in orthodox pharmaceutical research centres, where they strive to develop profitable custom-designed and patentable drugs to make money out of. Cures are not overtly sought by researchers in this stream, because cures are not profitable.</p>\n<p>The second is in institutional medical research and academic science circles affiliated with universities, although these cannot always be entirely separated from the first stream; because whenever there is a major discovery, its chances of seeing the light of full development seem to rapidly disappear unless it is taken up by a commercial interest; or it is otherwise subverted by orthodox pharmaceutical research teams to find patentable mutations of it. Some may only be picked up upon subsequently by accident, if maverick documentary researchers stumble onto them amidst the vast mountains of material accumulated in medical journal records. Sometimes when a disenchanted oncology researcher&#8217;s brilliant work has been abruptly terminated on a suspiciously poor pretext, he decides to \u201cgo public\u201d with whatever results he already has. This maverick dissemination of information is starting to happen more often through the Internet, because the World Wide Web is quite impossible for authorities or companies to completely control, or censor. And not every individual in the field of oncology has sold his soul to Big Pharma or the mighty Dollar.</p>\n<p>These maverick people more or less become part of the third stream, which also includes medicos who observe the poor performance record of orthodox oncology and who, by their powers of observation and reason, also discover likely solutions and proceed to exploit them for the greater genuine good. In the pursuit of their personal discoveries, some begin treating patients outside the scope of the medical orthodoxy and often produce very significantly better results. Not always, but many examples do exist. Unfortunately, successful and popular unorthodox treatments like these have frequently only perpetuated for as long as it took certain powers that control the medical system to move in and shut them down. The Twentieth Century is littered with persecuted and downfallen medical geniuses.</p>\n<p>Politics and economics aside, of particular significance as far as this Chapter is concerned are three important things.</p>\n<p>1. The first is the need to establish what causes cancer as accurately as possible and ideally to evolve a theory that suitably explains it, duly accounting for all of its possible elements from all the available data. The three parts of Chapter One have already embraced this requirement.</p>\n<p>2. The second is the need to distil a philosophical essence that distinguishes the hallmarks of a sensible approach to SAFELY fighting cancer in order to CURE it, whilst embracing humanity and quality of life; as opposed to one that is merely designed to treat the symptoms, or to make money. The basis of that essence establishes certain intrinsically FUNDAMENTAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLES, which can be said to be immutable. They are elucidated next in the second part of this Chapter.</p>\n<p>3. The third is to devise a strategy of treatment that addresses every known causality factor and every consideration regarding the most effective possible treatments for the patient, survival imperatives, proper welfare and quality of life; and so actually lives up to those requirements. These are embraced in the third, fourth and fifth parts of this Chapter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5843\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5843\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5843\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 6:10 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5843#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5843\", \"5843\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>B1. FUNDAMENTAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p>PRINCIPLES IN MEDICINE EXIST FOR A REASON. Six simple rules are set down here. These become the fundamental criteria to which any individual treatment of a cancer patient must conform to be entirely satisfactory. </p>\n<p>1. In the first instance, it must strive to minimise the incidence of cancer \u2013 to focus on prevention, since that is always better than cure. This, logically, depends firstly on education that promotes sensible lifestyle choices. It immediately predefines the need to preserve a proper biodynamic balance in the body as much as possible in the first place; but if it gets out of whack, as in the case of cancer, the treatment must instead aim to correctly restore the balance.</p>\n<p>2. It must be on the best available biological, clinical and therapeutic evidence. This should not presume out of hand that the medical orthodoxy is the sole possessor of that evidence. It most certainly is not, by any means; and a clinical trial result does not necessarily meet the criterion of empirical proof for efficacy and safety.</p>\n<p>3. It must strive to the utmost to render effective and absolute cure, which implies more than mere survival where possible. This firstly requires circumventing the financial imperatives that currently underpin the system, probably starting at the levels of government policy, regulation and subsidy of clinical trials. Secondly, at the grass roots level of treating the individual patient, it requires getting at the basic causes of the cancer, itself \u2013 and addressing those causes directly, rather than merely treating the symptoms. Thirdly, it requires holistic treatment of the patient, rather than the disease alone, or worse, its symptoms alone.</p>\n<p>4. It must not fail to provide a viable treatment to the patient \u2013 one with a satisfactory expectation of successful cure. This absolutely requires total destruction of the existing system in which double-blind placebo controlled medical trials may be regarded as a \u201cGold Standard\u201d in drug evaluation. It is nothing of the kind. Aside from the facts that placebo control in these studies is anything but an elimination of the Placebo Effect variable and that placebos are instead custom designed to corruptly make an experimental drug look better than it really is \u2013 the people on placebo are NOT being treated for their disease and are therefore being abused in a most unprincipled and cruel manner contrary to good medical principles and which, thanks to so-called placebos, are nevertheless caused to suffer similar side effects to those patients actually receiving the real experimental treatment, or worse  \u2013 not that mainstream experimental drugs in question may be expected to be satisfactory in their true efficacy, either. In this stream, such conduct as that of Dr. Charles Moertel of the Mayo Clinic, in having treated patients with sub-optimal doses of Vitamin C orally instead of intravenously and for only a tiny fraction of the duration of the trial in order to \u201cdisprove\u201d the treatment&#8217;s efficacy \u2013 did criminally fail to obey this vital principle and which faulty treatment he administered did directly result in unnecessary deaths. That is NOT medicine \u2013 it is MURDER.</p>\n<p>5. It must remove any potential for further harm that the cancer may cause to the patient. It must not bring harm or suffering to the patient, or endanger the patient in any ways additional to those for which the cancer is already directly responsible. This has ALWAYS been an essential principle in medicine \u2013 &#8220;DO NO HARM&#8221; \u2013 yet it is too frequently ignored in cancer therapy in a willingness to do whatever it takes to destroy tumours at the extreme risk to the patient&#8217;s safety, real survival chances and verily, life itself.</p>\n<p>6. Where possible, it must facilitate the greatest possible restoration from damage done by the cancer and enable the fullest possible recovery, together with the best possible quality of life, throughout the treatment and beyond. It must maximise freedom from sickness, debilitation, pain, confinement, constraint, melancholy, hopelessness, meaninglessness, fear and death itself. In all phases, this predefines the need to treat the patient \u2013 not just the disease.</p>\n<p>MOST CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS EXHIBIT NONE OF THESE HALLMARKS AND MEET NONE OF THE RESULTANT CRITERIA. ALL REMAINING CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS AND ORTHODOX TREATMENT PROTOCOLS SATISFY TOO FEW OF THESE CRITERIA TO BE WHOLLY SATISFACTORY.</p>\n<p>A small minority of more recently developed chemotherapy agents begin to more nearly approach this standard and permit scope for integration with others in safer, more effective protocols than was possible a generation or more ago, but still too often with severe shortcomings and limitations. New generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors or Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitors are not so much chemical warfare cytotoxins like most older ones and indeed, they are targeted therapies. They are instead designed to approach the treatment of cancer by impeding DNA replication or other key functions in the mitosis cycles of cancer cells in greater preference to healthy cells, rather than just slaughtering any multiplying cells. A very few, which again are mainly TKIs or CDKIs, are able to induce differentiation in cancer cells. Additionally, some TKIs or CDKIs will work against certain drug-resistant cancer types. It is without doubt a much more desirable direction to take, as it reduces serious toxicity problems, manifestly that of Tumour Lysis Syndrome. The exhibition of very much higher specificity to cancer cells than older chemo drugs; fewer side effects with less severity; and better efficacy against cancer represent distinct improvements that have been far too long in coming. They are still much too slow in coming and in concert with the various other therapies in common use by the orthodoxy, they are still largely inadequate.</p>\n<p>Moreover, whilst these and especially the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors are generally the best of the chemotherapy crop at present, this kind of enzyme inhibition is a common action amongst a wide range of perfectly natural Bioflavonoid and similar natural compounds. Their action is merely emulated by these artificial pharmaceutical constructs, but unlike the natural substances, most of the better chemo agents are also rather specific to particular types of cancer and they are therefore limited in their respective scopes of application. Most importantly, they are still not even remotely as effective as a whole range of alternative treatments, because they still fail in a critical department \u2013 they do not attack the root causes of the problem \u2013 particularly oxygenation, nutrition, systemic toxicity, microbes and immune condition; and furthermore, most of them exhibit poor efficacy against resistant populations, or no efficacy at all. In addition to these considerations, they are hideously expensive. Far too expensive \u2013 greed thrives in this industry \u2013 a lot of it. To top it off, there appears to be no orthodox protocols one might consider to be satisfactorily effective against CSC populations. These are precursive to MDRC malignancies, but are themselves amazingly resilient and able to come up with some very creative survival evolutions against many cancer treatments \u2013 alternative and orthodox alike \u2013 in the process of differentiating themselves towards an MDRC state, or something else. Yet at the same time, there are those that remain undifferentiated and these least-differentiated CSCs are believed by myself to be the central core of the resistant cancer problem.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, cure via genetic manipulation is still very new, with a long road of development ahead before it can become satisfactorily and safely effective, while effectiveness against those types of cancers it has been tested on still only stands at 7% as of 2009. Furthermore, the current state of the art in this particular field involves genetically engineered viruses functioning as carriers of recombinant DNA, which the author regards as potentially dangerous. D-Bait technology is still too new and may also have a nasty turn of side effects to account for, but we will not know for many years to come. Nanotechnology is still in its infancy; and stem cell research and medical treatment is so severely restricted in Europe, Australasia and North America on ethical grounds that once again, one must actually go overseas (in this case, China!) to gain access to it. The most recent advances made with stem cells created from genetically altered skin cells in Japan hold some promise for the not-too-distant future, if it can find its way past the minefield of &#8220;ethical&#8221; and commercial opposition.</p>\n<p>If the adage, \u201cYou only get what you pay for!\u201d were wholly true, you should actually be extremely well-paid to receive common mainstream chemotherapy drugs and likewise to become part of any clinical trials, where you would not even be guaranteed of receiving a course of new drugs, at all, but might instead be given older, nasty ones and placebos. Actually, the Placebo Control without any of these other filthy agents whatsoever would the best of the three groups in a blind clinical trial to be in, were it not that the placebos themselves are custom designed to produce some very nasty side effects (or even worse). They are kept absolutely secret. They&#8217;re not even revealed to the FDA when it approves the drug in question! How can the pharmaceutical corporations actually get away with that?? However, they usually only do Double Blind trials, where half the patients get the new drug, often in combination with an existing drug already in common use, whilst patients of the other half get the same older drug and a placebo&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Unless and until a better clinical trial system is evolved, this existing one is contributing to the impediment of serious cancer treatment advances in the orthodox mainstream and most importantly, it is perpetuating the sanction of a treatment system that is unprincipled, mercenary and brutal \u2013 one that willingly sacrifices peoples&#8217; lives to both cancer and to poisoning by dangerous chemotherapy drugs and placebos which never should have been approved for use.</p>\n<p>The shortcomings of the existing clinical trial system, to be more specific about them, are as follows:<br />\n1. The trials (in America especially) are not usually subsidised by the government, or if they are, they&#8217;re administered through the likes of the NCI. Therefore, only treatments or drugs with huge amounts of investment capital behind them can successfully cross the financial or \u201csuccessful trial\u201d barriers.<br />\n2. The trials are mounted by those entities who can afford to meet the massive cost. In the majority, that means Big Pharma. In some isolated instances, it means so-called charitable cancer research organisations, such as NCI.<br />\n3. In cases where entities such as NCI or NIH conduct the trials, Big Pharma still pulls the strings \u2013 ALL the strings.<br />\n4. The massive investment behind any given treatment or drug demands profitable return. Therefore, natural and hence unpatentable treatments do not qualify for commercial support, regardless of their true efficacy or safety.<br />\n5. The trials are designed, conducted and assessed by the very same entities who produce the drugs under trial. They deliberately doctor placebos to make the experimental treatments look better than they really are, while at the same time NOT serve their true intended purpose of eliminating the Placebo Effect as an unknown variable from the evaluation of the trial results.<br />\n6. The constituency of these placebos are NOT disclosed to the FDA, but kept secret, instead. In short, they shamelessly cook the books and the FDA lets them. Placebo design and use is one of the biggest loopholes through which Pharma is able to slip when conducting trials, because these are not subject to regulatory oversight. A placebo could actually be the filthiest, nastiest, most dangerous drug cocktail used in a clinical trial and nobody but  the pharmaceutical corporation would ever know it.<br />\n7. That opens the way to several different kinds of abuses that are perpetrated to guarantee commercial success.<br />\n8. One is deliberately faulty trial architecture contrived upon the use of older cancer agents still in common use, which are inferior and dangerous \u2013 as the comparative benchmark. Platins, Anthracyclines and Mustards are popular choices. The new treatment under test doesn&#8217;t need to be all that brilliantly better to win approval.<br />\n9. Another is narrow selection criteria imposed upon patients engaged in the trial.<br />\n10. Still another is loading the trial group cohorts and then downplaying or concealing this preselection conduct.<br />\n11. Another is fudging results and putting arbitrary spin on the reportage of them.<br />\n12. The government regulating bodies merely review the results. Sometimes that scrutiny may be close and assiduous, but usually, it is only perfunctory \u2013 witness what happened with Vioxx and Avandia. The bureaucrats whose responsibility it is to conduct the scrutiny are often lazy, complacent or incompetent; and in addition, they may be provided with incentives, such as large bribes or in less common cases, career-critical ultimatums in an environment riddled with political power plays \u2013 witness the exposure of this conduct on the part of the FDA by the \u201cFDA Nine\u201d.<br />\n13. The trials use the Double Blind design as the basic architectural framework. This penalises a proportion of the trial participants with their signed consent, but without their knowledge of what treatment they receive. It is a cruel lottery.<br />\n14. The trials are invariably narrow in scope and instead of using national or international statistics as the benchmark, they use the blinded dud drug as the direct comparison. Since this dud drug (placebo) is always custom engineered for the trial in question, it is not what it ought to be, but is instead a method of skewing trial results in the experimental drug&#8217;s favour.<br />\n15. As a basic benchmark definition of efficacy, they use percentage of tumour regression. That is a called a response rate. It is a faulty premise and contributes to the promotion of the false cancer treatment paradigm of aiming to kill cancer cells \u2013 rather than aiming to cure the causes of the disease.<br />\n16. They do not readily facilitate the application under trial of complex, sophisticated therapy systems, such as a full Integrative System treatment. Such forms of medicine are almost impossible to conduct under a Double Blind trial architecture because the differences between Orthodox and Integrative cancer treatment methods are so radically great that they cannot be blinded to the patients in order to eliminate placebo effect from the results; nor effectively randomised is such a way that \u201cassessment\u201d is insulated satisfactorily from bias.<br />\n17. The specific efficacies of the individual components of an Integrative Cancer Therapy System cannot be separately assessed under such conditions, so regardless of the overall effectiveness of such a treatment system, bureaucrats may be difficult, if not impossible to satisfy, because they cannot approve the individual components and cannot construct a rigid definition of the whole integrative treatment to approve, either. It&#8217;s too complex, too flexible and too fluid to force-fit into a codified framework of approved medical practice if defined in purely empirical terms. It&#8217;s only one of many inherent problems in allopathic medicine&#8217;s reductionist approach.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5844\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5844\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5844\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 6:23 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5844#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5844\", \"5844\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>B2. SUBSIDIARY TREATMENT PRINCIPLES &amp; CAUTIONS</p>\n<p>What follows here is a list of treatment principles that are subsidiary to the Fundamentals. They operate at a more &#8220;hands-on&#8221; level. This is a dynamic list of treatment refinements to which items are likely to be added over time with increasing expertise in treating cancer by Alternative methods. The first is an important warning to patients. The next two apply to &#8220;In-House&#8221; procedures when a given Treatment Phase is &#8220;gearing up&#8221; \u2013 that is, progressing from commencement to optimal levels of dosage for all agents and therapies being used in that particular Treatment Phase *A.</p>\n<p>1. Mixing Drugs Can Be Dangerous. Patients undergoing drug therapies often fail to tell their physicians of other medications they use concurrently \u2013 especially natural supplements added to prescription drugs. The problem is serious enough with ignorant medicos prescribing cocktails of pharmaceutical drugs. But adding herbal or other natural preparations to such cocktails often results also in unexpected interactions, side effects and occasionally, serious problems. Always inform your physician of ANY additional medications and preferably avoid mixing them altogether unless their interactive properties are known.<br />\n2. Administer First-Time-Used Agents Singly, At Least Two Hours Apart From Any Other. When intending to administer a selected treatment agent to a patient for the first time, do not do so together with others, not even when the drug interactions of ALL possible combinations of those currently in use with the newly administered agent are already clinically known. Undesirable drug interactions are merely the first aspect of this principle. The second aspect is individual patient reaction to a particular agent, which may be unexpected because the agent is generally known to be &#8220;perfectly safe&#8221;. Some people can be histaminically or anaphylactically sensitive to the most harmless, innocuous substances or foodstuffs \u2013 take peanuts for example. Symptoms of such unexpected reactions usually have rapid onset periods of less than one hour. With this in mind, administration of new agents should be separated by periods of at least two hours. Reactions which manifest after multiple first-time administrations of substances make it difficult or even impossible to identify the substance responsible for the problem. That would thereby force immediate cessation of all the substances administered at that time until somebody finds out which agent is responsible. When a single new substance is introduced in its own separate timeframe, its effects and interactions can be observed and noted to ensure relative safety. If reactionary symptoms appear in the patient within that timeframe, one can fairly safely attribute the problem to the last substance administered. That one agent can then be discontinued without any others also having to be stopped. Knowing what the responsible substance is, appropriate ameliorative measures can be taken quickly, without a whole series of time-consuming diagnostics and pathology tests being necessary. All this slows down the progression of therapeutic agents being added to a given treatment protocol, but ensures greater safety and a more reliable pattern of positive progress.<br />\n3. In Cases Of Unknown Possible Interactions Or Reactions By a Selected Therapy Agent, Begin With Small Doses And Increase Dose Incrementally Over Two-Hourly Intervals Towards The Appropriate Therapeutic Dose. Seven progressive events are possible. Using this principle will permit appropriate adjustment through the usual monitoring of vital signs, blood, urine, stools and so forth.<br />\n\t(a)   The first is progressive sensitisation to the agent (decreasing tolerance).<br />\n\t(b)   The second is progressive desensitisation to the agent (increasing tolerance).<br />\n\t(c)   The third is accumulation of the agent in the system, whose effects may not manifest until a critical threshold \t\t        is reached.<br />\n\t(d)   The fourth is an activated purgative mechanism in the system that increases its activity to get rid of the \t\t        agent, either by metabolism or by conjugation/extraction/expulsion.<br />\n\t(e)   The fifth is possible concentration-dependencies, since there are numerous substances that behave in a \t\t        particular way when concentration is within one range; yet behave in precisely the opposite manner when \t      \t        concentrations fall within a different range. One of Quercetin&#8217;s 99 bioactions operates like this.<br />\n\t(f)   The sixth is concentration-dependent synergy/potentiation through interaction with another substance.<br />\n\t(g)  The seventh is concentration-dependent agent antagonism/inhibition when interacting with another substance.<br />\nIf monitoring is specifically dependent upon urine or stool samplings in particular, two-hourly incremental       dosage intervals may be extended to accommodate the necessary tests, if time and resources permit.<br />\nIt is appreciated that this procedural approach to medication is resource-intensive and care-intensive. It is also appreciated that time and such resources may be at a premium, in limited supply, or costly. What usually ensues because of these considerations is a delicate balancing act, but in general, the best results are achieved by the best efforts. Therefore, though it may not always be possible to achieve absolute adherence to this principle, it must be striven for to the greatest practicable degree.<br />\n4. When A Patient Is Not Responding To An Existing Regime, It Is Necessary To Try Something Different, Based Upon Best Possible Options. One cannot expect different results when one continues to use the same method. So this does NOT mean upping dosages when the patient fails to respond. It means, \u201cExamine the causality of the problem and based on that, try something else.\u201d In extreme cases where all or most of the supposedly known and popularly used options have failed, this probably warrants venturing into the unknown, with the patient&#8217;s informed consent. Trial and error is not new in medicine, whether Orthodox, Traditional or Alternative. Even every kind of Orthodox chemotherapy is itself highly experimental at some level. Being experimental isn&#8217;t the real problem where the shortcomings of orthodox practice are concerned. Rather, the true problem lies in the medical principles underpinning the treatment, including and especially the very approach in the matter of precisely what conditions in the patient are being specifically treated. So it is stated here and repeated throughout Cancer&#8217;s Answers (even ad nauseam?) that unless the root causes of cancer are directly addressed \u2013 especially oxygenation, nutrition, systemic toxicity, microbes, psychology and immune condition \u2013 there can be NO completely satisfactory outcome. Instead, you might get either remission followed by relapse; or no remission at all in most cases; or you might get fatality resulting from the toxicity of the drug, itself (and drug fatality is one of the NORMAL outcomes when it is a typical cytotoxic chemotherapy drug). So experimentation in medicine within the limits of certain obvious cautions is fine, provided that it is realistically designed to achieve the right aims. But this is where chemo and radiotherapy fail at the most fundamental level. They aim to achieve the wrong thing (near-indiscriminate cell slaughter) and tolerate too many other wrong things in the process \u2013 it&#8217;s not in the experimentation as such that any fault resides. But in every such case involving experiment, the preceding two subsidiary principles should be adhered to in the greatest degree that is practically possible in the circumstances. This fourth principle is one important reason that many &#8220;terminal&#8221; cancer patients given up for dead by orthodox medicine actually survive long-term or even defeat the disease \u2013 they seek something different and under some such Alternative regimes, a good 50% and even up to 80% of them do actually defeat the disease *B. NEVER SAY DIE!</p>\n<p>*A. Treatment Phase: Treatment Phases are an evolution in Integrated Cancer Therapies and are fully explained in the following Section.<br />\n*B. Up to 80%: The sole use of the Zeolite mineral Clinoptilolite has yielded a 78% full remission among terminal cancer patients in a trial lasting 14 months after being given up for dead by mainstream medicine. Therefore, this figure is not only completely realistic, but can even be exceeded without much difficulty through the use of additional treatment components.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5845\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5845\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5845\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 6:30 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5845#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5845\", \"5845\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>C. PHASES IN A GENERAL TREATMENT STRATEGY</p>\n<p>It is of course perfectly logical and indeed, it is absolutely necessary to fully address ALL applicable causality factors in any intrinsically sound treatment strategy. The fewer relevant factors adequately tackled by a given treatment, the less effective it will be.</p>\n<p>A general approach to this is outlined in a 29-point strategy. The Strategy is based upon six specific Treatment Phases, during which particular aspects of a Treatment Plan may be selectively used concurrently, or in specific cases, sequentially applied. It is structured so, because timing has been noted for its importance with respect to such factors as buying time in critical cases; certain incompatibilities among some treatments or agents, which cannot be administered concurrently; different optimums required for the treatment of particular cancer types such as MDRCs; and other considerations. Thus, certain parts of the overall strategy can be applied during certain Phases, but perhaps not during others. It should be noted that although the whole plan is generally modelled in keeping with the DUCTOC philosophy, some particular importance squarely rests within the narrowed scope of VIMTOCC, whereby the more significant imperatives associate with thorough eradication of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, other microbes and resistant malignancies that cannot be differentiated or rendered benign. When these are eliminated and biodynamic balance is restored, cancer cannot proliferate. When they are not, cancer is highly likely to persist, or to rebound.</p>\n<p>The Six Phases have been defined as follows.</p>\n<p>1. DIAGNOSTIC PHASE (Initial): Clearly, you need to know exactly what&#8217;s what, so that you&#8217;re not proceeding blind and treating your cancer on assumptions. It is essential from the outset to ascertain the particular nature of the cancer involved and to relate that with the evidence of pathology tests. These must identify all possible cancer cells &amp; colonies by location, population size, cell line and bio-characteristics (whether PCC, NRCC, CSC, MDRC, ER+, Philadelphia Chromosome +, etc.); viruses, bacteria, funghi, yeasts, toxins, extraordinary hormones, proteins, enzymes, deficiencies and so on that are present in the system, both throughout the body and within particular organs or tissues. It extends to include lifestyle assessment and the less obvious \u2013 matters emotional and spiritual, wherein the guidance of skilled people who care can help to determine what problems of these kinds may be present and determine methods to deal with them \u2013 depression, or even a simple negative mental attitude belief, like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got cancer \u2013 I&#8217;m as good as dead,&#8221; for example. Such beliefs too easily become self-fulfilling prophecies, so they truly must be assessed like any other aspect of a patient&#8217;s condition; and if diagnosed, they must be addressed, rather than ignored. These measures enable tailoring of the treatment for optimal results, both medically and in the broader, holistic sense embracing body, mind, heart and soul. Specific diagnostics must also be conducted regularly throughout any cancer treatment to monitor progress and safety, but these will be appropriate to their own respective Phases.</p>\n<p>2. STABILISATION PHASE (Early): This Phase aims to stabilise the patient&#8217;s overall biodynamic condition and even to normalise it as much and as quickly as possible by stemming further proliferation or worsening of the condition and to some degree, to commence reversal of it without triggering terminal complications such as haemorrhage or TLS. It should include preconditioning treatments designed to protect the patient from undesirable side effects that may be induced by the agents used in subsequent phases of treatment. In critical cases, it aims to buy time so that aggressive treatments, which need to be paced in order to avoid such complications can proceed satisfactorily and safely. This involves initiating holistic principles, such as diet, lifestyle, emotional and spiritual enhancement; Immune and Nervous System reinforcements; administration of detoxification, differentiation, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, oxidative preconditioning or similar agents; and other appropriate measures that don&#8217;t directly attack and slaughter the cancer cells themselves too aggressively. It should quickly promote a bodily environment that is generally hostile to cancer as an overall condition \u2013 thereby causing proliferation arrest and a partial regression of the condition, together with a strengthening of the patient&#8217;s general constitution. It may also include adjuvant treatments for such corollary conditions or complications that attend cancer, such as pain, inflammation, cachexia, bone metastasis, jaundice and so on. In all cases, it strives to improve one&#8217;s own natural immune response. It is more particularly so in Post-Chemo cases, where it also tries to restore some semblance of functionality to the Immune System and any other damaged systems or organs as quickly as possible, both to extend survival initially; and to enhance the effectiveness and safety of ongoing treatments, quality of life and recovery. In certain cases, it may be geared to restore drug-sensitivity to previously resistant cancers. Among other things, the aims of the Early Phase extend to include informational, psychological, emotional and spiritual counselling. These measures should help the patient to better understand the condition, regain a sense of being more in control of his or her life, allay fear, strengthen resolve and restore optimism. In emergency cases resulting from very advanced and aggressive cancers, more potent cytotoxic agents may become necessary during the initial part of this Phase and in these cases, a short course of Acetogenins (perhaps for a week or so) or a short course on a Rife Machine can do the trick. Using Acetogenins may impose restrictions upon what other agents may be employed as treatment components of this Phase. But with that respite gained, the other salient components of this Phase that are not compatible with Acetogenins can be engaged after the short course of Acetogenins is discontinued.</p>\n<p>3. SENSITIVE MALIGNANCY PHASE (Mid): This Phase aims to reduce non-resistant tumour masses including metastatic ones as rapidly as is safely possible to a point where most of what remains of a malignant population comprises mainly CSCs, MDRCs and MDRMs. To the best extent possible, principles and treatments used in the Early Phase continue to be applied, but in going after the non-resistant population of malignancies, more aggressive apoptogens or in some rare cases, necrotics may be used in this phase, when the patient is suitably able to cope without undue stress or harm. It seeks in the meantime to avoid triggering the genesis or proliferation of resistant populations; or the creation of new complications. Fairly close monitoring is necessary for several reasons. Firstly, total tumour mass may be expected to be not much less around the commencement of this Phase than it was at commencement of the Stabilisation Phase and may even be greater. Whilst it is desirable to reduce that mass as swiftly as possible, the rate of reduction must be very carefully limited by the risk of Tumour Lysis Syndrome. As such, Potassium, Phosphate and Calcium levels must be closely watched. Secondly, the duration of this Phase must be determined according to the Law Of Diminishing Returns. When the rate of tumour mass regression becomes noticeably slower, this is probably an indicator that the remaining malignancy comprises a higher proportion of resistant cells. It marks the time when the Sensitive Malignancy Phase must give way to the Resistant Malignancy Phase. In the special case of refractory cancers where minimal or no population regression by the typical differentiators, apoptogens or necrotics can be achieved, this treatment Phase is immediately superseded by the Late Phase with the employment of Acetogenins, Berberine and selected adjuvants or supplements. The same approach may also be employed temporarily as part of the Stabilisation Phase in cases where the cancer is very advanced or very aggressive, in order to gain a satisfactory respite. However, a separate Emergency Strategy was devised with that in mind and is described in Section E of this Chapter.</p>\n<p>4. RESISTANT MALIGNANCY PHASE (Late): This Phase is a special stage of the strategy, which recognises that drug-resistant malignancies require special treatment quite distinct from that applied to the more general malignant population. Here, Acetogenins mainly represent the best answer to this special problem of a resistant population, both in cancer cells and microbes, because they are so specifically effective in neutralising the function of molecular efflux pumps and their associated mediators. Since there is a potential neural side effect problem that must be considered with heavy or extended use of Acetogenins, their otherwise powerful efficacy against any cancer cells or bacteria is not taken advantage of during the earlier phases, unless it is made imperative by other considerations. This avoids possible neural complications arising unnecessarily and it also permits the use of a range of other agents that are incompatible with Acetogenins during other Phases. During this Late Phase, the Acetogenins serve the purpose of eliminating the MDRC and MDRM populations including residual metastatic ones, as well as helping to clean up surviving viruses. Berberine is another option with MDRM and MDRC efficacy. They are also expected to eradicate most of the residual CSC population, but not all, since Acetogenins like Bullatacin have shown themselves to be merely cytostatic towards some lines of CSC, rather than cytotoxic. This being the case, the use of Acetogenins may not constitute the complete solution \u2013 these Acetogenin-static CSCs can hold their own until the treatment is discontinued and then resume propagating. However, it is known that Acetogenins cause accumulation of other toxins, including any adjuvant drugs used and it is also known that agents such as Piperine and Chavicine retard metabolism and so cause a similar condition. Assuming that preconditioning and cell differentiating treatments have been administered prior to the execution of this Phase; and on the further presumption that they can also be selectively used during this Phase, it should nevertheless be possible to produce a definitively positive result with certain adjuvant cytotoxic agents and Immune System modulators. Since what remains to the Acetogenins during this Phase should normally be a relatively small surviving population, the duration and indeed the overall dosage of Acetogenins required to complete the task should be minimal. It should not exceed thirty days, the recommended limit of time over which a sustained course of Acetogenins should be administered before a spell is taken. But it is critical to ensure that the cancer is eliminated to the extent that it will not relapse, due to even a small surviving number of resistant cells, stem cells or bacteria. In the special case of refractory cancers of any kind, the Sensitive Malignancy Phase is superseded by this Resistant Malignancy Phase, which presumes that Acetogenins and some other selected supplements must be kept in use for longer than would otherwise be necessary. It is hoped that in such instances, the course should still not exceed thirty days and that in any case, neural detriment is kept minimal. Mainly during the Stabilisation Phase, a treatment called Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy can be used to improve tolerance of (and protection from) the oxidative effects of Acetogenins, but that may not ameliorate susceptibility to neuropathy. It is also hoped that THC may offer a compatible solution to the increased risk to the Central Nervous System through its neuroprotective and neural regenerative properties. Both approaches might allow extension of an Acetogenin course, but this latter approach using THC still needs to be tested somehow and so must be regarded with reserve. One might consider trying it if other measures fail. THC itself has a very high safety ratio, where dosage can be optimised easily to within the optimal neuroprotective range without danger, except to that 0.1% of the population which may be susceptible to psychotic episodes; and of course in any instances where potentially hazardous function-critical tasks such as driving are concerned.</p>\n<p>5. CONVALESCENT PHASE (Very Late): This Phase provides for convalescence that primarily involves regeneration and recuperation from any erstwhile harm done to the patient, such as to the Immune System, Nervous System, or organs, as a result of prior administration of harmful chemotherapies; or damage caused by cancer itself. It provides for the administration of any healing agents that should not be used when attacking malignant populations, due to any possible tendencies of the regenerative agents to neutralise the effect of anticarcinomics, or promote renewed cancer proliferation. This may not apply to all healing agents. If they provide for healing by promoting cellular differentiation and not by promoting cell proliferation, they should be otherwise quite useful through both Malignancy Phases of the treatment. During this Convalescent Phase, some final cleaning up of dead cells, toxins, microbes and other detritus is carried out and provides for continued or resumed administration of differentiating agents, antimicrobial agents, immune and nervous system stimulants, detox and any further constitutional enhancements.</p>\n<p>6. REMISSION PHASE (Final): The Remission Phase is designed to ensure that the whole treatment is completely successful and that relapse does not occur. In addition to the general, holistic or recuperative measures that characterise the Stabilisation or Convalescent Phases, this phase also involves regular ongoing pathology and close monitoring of the patient for a minimum period of 12 months following completion of the Convalescent Phase. Some of the best cancer treatment facilities and their staff actually provide for indefinite support in a multiplicity of ways, including post-treatment diagnostics. This Phase should also aim to ensure the patient is wholly familiarised with lifestyle approaches to preventing future occurrence of the condition, which requires education. Yes, that might even extend to a form of &#8220;patient conditioning&#8221; if the patient is willing and suffers from lifestyle dysfunctionality caused by deep-seated subconscious behavioural traits. The aim is to ensure that good living habits are likely to persist in the long-term. Some people embrace lifestyle changes quite readily when motivated in the right ways or by the right reasons, but those ways differ considerably from one person to the next, as do the most effective &#8220;training methods&#8221;. Therefore, as is true of any other phase of treatment, the Remission Phase is tailored to the individual needs of the patient.</p>\n<p>The next Section D of this Chapter describes how the various Treatment Components are generally applied through these 6 Phases, thus embodying a Phased Cancer Treatment Strategy.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5846\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5846\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5846\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 7:36 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5846#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5846\", \"5846\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>D.  PICTS \u2013 PHASED INTEGRATIVE CANCER TREATMENT STRATEGY</p>\n<p>The Fundamental (Philosophical) and Subsidiary Treatment Principles form the basis of a good approach to cancer treatment. The Phases define the basic structure of that approach, each with its particular set of objectives. The Treatment Components form the constituency of the treatment regimes.</p>\n<p>What follows here is a description of how the Components are applied with respect to the 6 Treatment Phases and in some cases, preceding or following them. This is the core embodiment of HICs \u2013 the Holistically Integrated Cancer Strategy. It&#8217;s by no means an ironcast structured regimen, but a flexible framework of guidelines. Intelligent adaptability is much more desirable than rigid conformity \u2013 knowledge, thought and care is required to exercise optimal choices within the scope of this framework.</p>\n<p>Treatment                               Treatment<br />\nComponents                            Phases</p>\n<p>                             Prior  Diag  Stab  Sens  Resi  Conv  Remi  After<br />\nMedical Expertise             X        X       X        X        X       X        I<br />\nHolistics                  I         X        X       X        X        X       X        I<br />\nMicrobiome             I         X        X       X        X        X       X        I<br />\nDiet                         I         X        X       X        X        X       X        I<br />\nDetox                      I                   X                           X       X        I<br />\nPreconditioning                          X       A        A<br />\nAnalgesia                                   A       A        A<br />\nImmune System       I                  X       X        S       X       X        I<br />\nNervous System      I                   X       X        S       X       X        I<br />\nDifferentiation                             X       X        S       X       X<br />\nElectromedical                            L       L        L       L<br />\nPotentiation                                A        A       S       A<br />\nRedox                                         X        X       S       A<br />\nRe-energising                             X        X                X       X<br />\nAntifungal                                    X        X       S      X       X<br />\nAntibacterial                                X         X      S      X       X<br />\nAntiparasitic                                X         X       S     X       X<br />\nAntiviral                                       X         X       S     X       X<br />\nNRCCs                                        A         X<br />\nBrain Cancer                               A        A       S<br />\nAnticachexia                                A        A       A      A<br />\nBone Resorption                         A        A       S<br />\nLiver Cancer                               A         A       S<br />\nProtect/Rescue                           A         A       S      A<br />\nMDRCs/MDRMs                          R         R       X      A<br />\nCSCs/LECSCs                                                 X      A<br />\nPregnancy                                   G        G       G     G      G<br />\nRegeneration                                                           X       A<br />\nCompletion                                                                        X       A<br />\nEmergency                                  E</p>\n<p>The chart above frames the 6 Phases and 29 Components of the Phased Cancer Treatment Strategy. It shows which Components may be used during each of the Treatment Phases. The following texts explain it in better detail. Duration of each respective Treatment Phase cannot be specified.</p>\n<p>Each is very much dependent upon ongoing diagnostics, which are vital elements of Component 1 in the form of &#8220;Medical Expertise&#8221;. The other elements of this first component are:- skilled, qualified medical and support personnel; appropriate amenities and equipment; and appropriate determination of detailed strategy design, treatment choices and dosages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;S&#8221; &#8220;Suitable&#8221; in the &#8220;Resistant&#8221; column, is a warning that refers to making sure of compatibility between agents used, because that Phase of the Strategy mainly involves the use of Acetogenins, with which there are many other incompatible agents. Compatibility issues may also surface in other treatment phases, which is one of the main reasons that the strategy has been structured in phases. It provides for separation of treatments that may be incompatible with each other to apply appropriately in their own most useful times of a patient&#8217;s period of treatment and convalescence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;L&#8221; &#8220;Limited or Restraint&#8221; in Row 11, &#8220;Electromedical&#8221; warns that this technology must not be over-used, especially during the &#8220;Stabilisation&#8221; and &#8220;Sensitive&#8221; Phases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;R&#8221; &#8220;Resistant&#8221; in Row 25, &#8220;MDRCs, MDRMs&#8221; indicates that if the cancer is resistant, then the &#8220;Stabilisation&#8221; and &#8220;Sensitive&#8221; phases are superseded by Resistant Malignancy treatment options as a matter of priority, to whatever extent is appropriate in the circumstances. Normally, the treatment of MDRCs and MDRMs is confined to the &#8220;Resistant&#8221; phase.</p>\n<p>&#8220;G&#8221; \u201cGestation\u201d in Row 27 means due consideration must be given to antiproliferative treatment effects upon an unborn child when the cancer patient is pregnant, so as to avoid abortion or birth defects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A.&#8221; means &#8220;As Required&#8221; or &#8220;When, or if needed&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8221; &#8220;Ideally&#8221; means the component or at least some elements of it should ideally be applied beyond the period of cancer treatment \u2013 whether before, after, or both. By logical definition, it is the practice of prevention.</p>\n<p>ECTS:\u2013 in addition to the 29 Components, the Emergency Cancer Treatment Strategy&#8217;s place in the Phased Strategy is shown. In this, any or all of the Components applicable to the Stabilisation Phase likewise apply and may be used within normal limits of compatibility. See Chapter 2E.</p>\n<p>NRCCs are \u201cNon-Resistant Cancer Cells\u201d. These respond normally to typical apoptogenic treatments.</p>\n<p>MDRCs are \u201cMulti-Drug-Resistant Cells\u201d, which in being equipped with efflux pumps, do not respond to normal apoptogenic or cytotoxic treatments.</p>\n<p>MDRMs are \u201cMulti-Drug-Resistant Microbes\u201d, which may be bacteria, funghi (including yeasts) or even protozoa that are likewise equipped with efflux pumps and do not respond to normal microbicides.</p>\n<p>CSCs are \u201cCancer Stem Cells\u201d, which are malignant stem cells that like the healthy stem cells serving as progenitors for the various other specialised cells in the human system, are highly undifferentiated and geared to a very high rate of multiplication and able to generate daughter cells with particular specialities, such as multi-drug resistance.</p>\n<p>LECSCs are \u201cLow Energy Cancer Stem Cells\u201d, which are malignant stem cells in a dormant state, much as you find most healthy stem cells in an adult are dormant until required to generate replacement cells in the body due to damage or senescence. LECSCs are resistant or cytostatic to Mitochondrial Complex I Inhibitors such as Acetogenins and Berberine.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5847\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5847\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5847\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 8:05 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5847#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5847\", \"5847\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Space tabulations for column conformity in the table didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p>Correction as follows &#8211;  &#8220;o&#8221; means not applicable to the corresponding phase. &#8220;X&#8221; means fully applicable.

Nevertheless, it should serve as an adequate guide.</p>\n<p>The PHASES are:<br />\nDiagnostic (Initial)<br />\nStabilisation (Early)<br />\nSensitive Malignancy (Mid)<br />\nResistant Malignancy (Late)<br />\nConvalescent (Very Late)<br />\nRemission (Final)</p>\n<p>The COMPONENTS are:</p>\n<p>1. QUALIFIED EXPERTISE \u2013 Everyone has probably heard of some people who defeated terminal cancer by treating themselves. They are either skilled individuals, or lucky; and they are in the minority among cancer survivors. To maximise your chances, remember to use the services and amenities provided by skilled, qualified practitioners and their facilities, especially for Stage III and IV cancers. Be prepared to hunt for them, because if choosing alternative methods, practitioners who willingly accommodate alternative methods may not be easy to find in convenient proximity to where you live. Diagnostics are vital in this, for it is essential from the outset to ascertain the particular nature of the cancer involved and to relate that with the evidence of pathology tests. These must identify all possible cancer cells &amp; colonies, viruses, bacteria, funghi, yeasts, toxins, extraordinary hormones, genetic problems, proteins, enzymes, deficiencies, pH, oxidative stress markers and so on that are present in the system, both throughout the body and within particular organs or tissues. This will enable tailoring of the treatment for optimal results. Also, in order to pace a treatment correctly, ongoing tests to closely monitor Toxins, Oxidative Stress Markers, Potassium, Phosphate and Calcium levels in blood, tissues and kidneys is very important. The three lattermost levels (K, PO4 &amp; Ca) can mark the difference between life and death, quite literally \u2013 they are the markers of the deadly condition called TLS \u2013 Tumour Lysis Syndrome. Critical element, all phases.<br />\n2. HOLISTICS \u2013 Mind, Body, Heart &amp; Soul. A healthy, social lifestyle with plenty of exercise, learning, love, creativity, recreational fun, success and fulfilment makes a difference that cannot be over-emphasised and must never be underestimated. Include things like Meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, Massage and preferably also family life and community involvement to enhance these elements. Hypnotherapy can benefit some people, but not all. Make sure you place a great deal of importance upon Faith in your own success. Visualise that success as a foregone reality. Likewise, believe in a higher design, purpose and meaning in life. That does not require belief in some god, but genuine religious faith does actually work. Any strong and genuine faith does. Don&#8217;t go to bed and try to sleep it all off. Stay active, do worthwhile things and thus proactively live your life. Skilled counselling is a valuable adjuvancy in this aspect of treatment at both the emotional and spiritual levels, with ongoing personal growth and development being significant elements. In most aspects, this is a lifetime practice and more \u2013 a way of life.<br />\n3. MICROBIOME \u2013 Probiotic microorganism culture and the prebiotic saccharides such as FOS, GOS &amp; TOS to feed them. These are important, since among their numerous functions, symbiotic gut flora are among your first lines of defence against pathogenic organisms. They modulate the Immune system, neutralise toxins, attack pathogens, aid digestion and absorption of valuable nutrients and even create many essential vitamins. They help control propensity to diabetes, obesity, IBS, coeliac disease and other chronic illnesses. They protect the gut membranes and help prevent inflammation, DNA damage, leaky gut syndrome, auto-immune diseases and perform other important functions. They will protect the GIT from colon and duodenal cancers and fight existing cancers in the intestinal tract. It is critically important to realise that mainstream antibiotics are harmful to your symbiotic flora. When these are depleted by taking antibiotics, then resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria can take over and create serious problems for which you no longer have your natural protection. But the problem goes much further. Not only do you lose the capacity of the probiotics to control pathogenic populations in the gut, but you also lose all the other internal regulating and protective mechanisms that your symbiotic flora provide. It\u2019s a double whammy and there is NO up side. Keep your symbiotic flora healthy and stay away from antibiotics! All Phases and ideally a lifetime practice.<br />\n4. DIET \u2013 Johanna Budwig, Robert O. Young, Johanna Brandt, Max Gerson or other dedicated cancer diets with all the needed nutrients, vitamins and minerals to restore a healthy biodynamic balance. Supernutrient formula supplements are valuable. Some selected constituents of such a diet should be discontinued before the Late Phase of treatment against MDRCs, due to possible incompatibilities with Acetogenins. Though the knowledge base has improved and several substances previously thought to be incompatible have been found to be compatible, or even synergistic in some cases, consideration and care should be given to the inclusion of Vitamins C &amp; E and any strong antioxidants such as Essiac, SOD and stronger Flavonoids directly with Acetogenin treatment. All these are very common constituents of good anticancer diets. Some of these dedicated diets are incompatible with other cancer treatments, so choose carefully when designing your strategy. Otherwise, the diet is sustained throughout the treatment and a more generalised health diet is sustained beyond the treatment period; for example, the Arnold Ehret (Vegan style) or Mediterranean Diet. Ideally a lifetime practice, allowing for incompatibilities. All-vegetarian diets MUST be supplemented with Vitamin B12; and this is especially critical with children, because if they&#8217;re on exclusive vegetarian diets, they can become radically deficient in B12 and suddenly drop DEAD without warning. Adequate meat in the diet solves the problem. There is a botanical species that yields B12 \u2013 Angelica Keiskei (Ashitaba), a Japanese plant listed in the Botanical Catalogue, but for most people, red meat is the easiest and best option. Saturated animal fats in meat are important nutritional components that synergise with Vitamins A, D3, E and K2.<br />\n5. DETOX \u2013 Eliminating toxic substances from organs is critical, yet at the same time is a complex, fairly sensitive and very lengthy process that can take years. Clinoptilolite (Zeolite) is truly superlative and greatly simplifies a detox program, because it is completely non-toxic, both a chelator and an adsorbant, in addition to its immunomodulatory and apoptogenic actions and requires less care in balancing the mobilisation and elimination of toxins. It will relieve the liver of a great deal of its detox burden and thus greatly accelerate the detox process, whereas several of the other chelating agents like DMPS, EDTA, NDGA, DMSA or IP6 are mobilisers and can effectively increase the blood toxicity and liver burden by leaching toxins from the tissues, yet not quite as effectively eliminate them from the system. Thus, these others rely on liver function and the process must proceed slowly. St. John&#8217;s Wort is valuable, because as a liver tonic, it enhances the rate at which the liver can process toxins in order to get rid of them. Another choice detox agent is MCP, which offers the same advantages as Clinoptilolite, plus the extra advantage of not requiring much at all in the way of mineral replacement that Clinoptilolite imposes. EDTA, DMSA, DMPS, IP6, BDET and NDGA are in various ways effective in some limited detoxification role, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. Many Flavonoids and several Amazon plants are also useful in this capacity: especially Hispidulin and its major natural sources \u2013 three Amazon Asteraceae known as Carqueja (Baccharis Genistelloides, Gaudicaudiana and Trinervis). MSM, Glucuronic Acid, Ubiquinol CoQ10, SOD and Glutathione are very valuable, but the latter three cannot survive oral ingestion unless they are first proofed against breakdown in the Gastrointestinal Tract by chemical complexation or conjugation. Although intravenous administration may circumvent that problem, it preferentially requires medical assistance. Bentonite Clay or Charcoal are very useful as mild detox agents, but exclusively as intestinal heavy metal adsorbants \u2013 they are not pan-systemic. So if other agents like DMPS mobilise heavy metal toxins out of the tissues and the liver doesn&#8217;t manage to process them before they can re-embed in the tissues, these three and Clinoptilolite or MCP will take at least some of them up and carry them out through the GIT. Always supplement detox with minerals and supernutrients to restore those important ones that may also be removed by the detox. Only MCP may circumvent the need for mineral supplementation. Supplementation is alternated with detox dosages involving suitable periods of separation \u2013 they are not taken together and I recommend separation periods of two to three hours. Stabilisation, Convalescent and Remission Phase treatment, but ideally should also be done on a regular basis as a preventive measure to maintain good health. An important consideration for anyone who has Mercury-Silver dental amalgams is the comprehensive removal of them, but the procedure must be carried out by a specialist who is properly trained in their safe removal. If done by a regular dental or medical surgeon who is not so trained, the operation can result in a catastrophic release of additional Mercury into the system and in isolated cases, it can be fatal. The timing can also be critical, because there are times when certain other priorities may contraindicate undertaking this measure until the decks are cleared of more immediate medical problems. Only an expert can advise you on \u201cexactly when\u201d will be an appropriate time in the course of a general detox or cancer treatment program. Pretreatment with detoxification agents and particularly with the likes of Clinoptilolite or MCP before and after the removal procedure is necessary to minimise system uptake of that amount of Mercury, which the procedure may cause to be released. In general, the continued presence of Mercury dental work in one&#8217;s mouth is highly detrimental to general health, immunity, cognitive function and recovery from cancer or any number of other acute and chronic diseases. That is so even to the point of frequently (or usually!) being responsible for CAUSING them. Mercury fillings are not safe, but instead are highly toxic, often to the point of being extremely dangerous. It is the second most toxic of all metals, superseded only by Plutonium and it DOES leach out of the fillings. There are no exceptions.<br />\n6. PRECONDITIONING \u2013 Oxidative Preconditioning is a treatment designed to stimulate the production of natural endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, CoQ10 or Glutathione from within, which in turn protect the patient from complications and side effects of subsequent anticarcinomic treatments in which Reactive Oxygen Species are dosed or produced within the body, ostensibly to destroy the cancer. It has special importance with regard to the later use of Acetogenins, Vitamin C Megadosoing or even orthodox chemotherapies in a complementary or integrated medicine strategy, because Acetogenins, Vitamin C and most orthodox chemo agents either trigger production of Reactive Oxygen Species, or they are ROS themselves. These cause Oxidative Stress that leads to apoptosis, but healthy tissues need selective protection and endogenous antioxidants achieve this aim beautifully. The best oxidative treatments currently available are O3-AHT (Ozone Autohaemotherapy) or H2O2-AHT (Hydrogen Peroxide Autohaemotherapy) in which 200 ml to 600 ml of the patient&#8217;s blood is removed and infused with Ozone or Hydrogen Peroxide. The Ozone or H2O2 reacts with blood components to generate a number of oxide products, which will signal the presence of Oxidative Stress to the body&#8217;s defences when the blood is reintroduced to the patient; but without actually causing the stress, itself. Actually, it does a great deal more, so you should refer to the latest data I have on these oxidative therapies in which they are described as cure-all treatments. There are very strong Immune System boosting, antibacterial (anaerobic strains), antiviral, antifungal and anticarcinomic benefits. The procedure is usually repeated several times over several days in increments that are safely and easily tolerated. This treatment is used with considerable success and the highest safety in Europe; and also by the Contreras (Oasis Of Hope) Hospital of Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, California. Stabilisation (Early) Phase as a rule, but may be used in other Phases where there are no incompatibilities or contraindications. Administration by qualified medical personnel only, although food grade H2O2 can be self-administered orally in very small doses thrice daily at concentrations of 1% or less. Likewise, so can Chlorine Dioxide or food grade DMSO to very similar effect. DMSO @ 70% to 100% concentration can be administered topically, since it is highly transdermal in this strength range and that is usually the best way of using it. MSM can be taken orally and this is internally reduced to yield DMSO within the tissues.<br />\n7. ANALGESIA &amp; ANTI-INFLAMMATION \u2013 Since pain and tissue inflammation commonly attend cancer, these symptoms need to be attenuated for the patient&#8217;s comfort when they occur, but preferably without interfering with other aspects of combating the cancer and preferably without depressing system functions. Furthermore, anti-inflammatories which specifically 5-LPO and/or Cox-2 also have anticarcinomic effects. Agents that target and neutralise NF-Kappa-\uf062 , 5-LPO and Cox-2 or their receptors are therefore very valuable, but be cautious of any that also inhibit Cox-1. Diclofenac (Voltaren) is okay within limits, but Vioxx is too active against Cox-1 and actually doubles the risk of heart attack. Vioxx has been known to kill, but I believe it has been taken off the market. For strong analgesia, orthodox medicine prefers to use opiates like Morphine. This is a very nasty, addictive drug with side effects and it can kill. DMSO is far more preferable and so is THC \u2013 you must ingest a lot of either one of these to get seriously ill \u2013 they have extremely high safety coefficients. Watch for haemorrhagic effects or Liver trauma with DMSO \u2013 in other words, don&#8217;t use too much DMSO, build the dosage up slowly over 10 to 21 days in the same way as any other oxidative agent, don&#8217;t prolong it at therapeutic doses and make absolutely sure it is administered under watchful medical supervision, especially if using it to potentiate another substance. An active differentiating anticancer agent, it&#8217;s also a very effective analgesic as strong as Morphine and an anti-inflammatory agent with additional chelating, potentiating, synergistic, antiviral, oxygenating and numerous other functions. It is safer, exhibits far fewer side effects and lasts about three times longer than Morphine. MSM can be used as an oral substitute, since it reduces to DMSO within the tissues. Laetrile and Amygdalin are very strong anticarcinomics, very potent analgesics because they release the anaesthetic Benzaldehyde; and are also very effective anti-inflammatory agents. They are very safe when of high purity, are administered intravenously under good medical care and cause no serious side effects within sensible dosage limits. The heavy alkali metal salts Caesium and Rubidium Chloride are also very good at reducing inflammation and pain, in addition to being potent anticarcinomics \u2013 these also require close medical supervision. Acetogenins are extremely powerful anticarcinomic agents with additional analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and other beneficial effects. They are relatively safe and require significant dosages over extended periods to manifest possible neurodegenerative effects, so they are mainly recommended for use in the Late Phase for utmost safety. THC or Cannabis is likewise a powerful anticarcinomic with very good, long lasting analgesic effects, plus potent neuroprotective and neural regenerative properties within certain dosage limits. Cannabinoids are among the safest and least toxic analgesics for short or medium-term use, although they&#8217;re pyschotropic and mildly addictive. None of the others are addictive or psychotropic. By contrast, Morphine is in no way anticarcinomic or neuroprotective and may not even be all that wonderfully anti-inflammatory. It is also psychotropic and highly addictive. It&#8217;s not especially safe, either. It has a terrible secondary role in cancer therapy, which is that of palliative auto-euthanasia. It is used to kill the patient painlessly. Any of the suggested alternatives to Morphine may be used in isolation, since all have anticancer actions, while some such as DMSO are better used in concert with other agents (with the proper care). There may be synergy or compatibility concerns with DMSO or Acetogenins, indicating selective use of perhaps one suitable analgesic agent or combination during some treatment phases; and different agents in other treatment phases \u2013 when required to attenuate the symptoms. Laetrile or Amygdalin used with DMSO in the Stabilisation (Early) to Sensitive Malignancy (Mid) Phase; THC generally and also for any non-refractory brain cancers; or Acetogenins in the Resistant Malignancy (Late) Phase &amp; refractory brain cancers, possibly with THC. Since all these agents can play other important roles in cancer therapy, they may in fact remain in use when there is no need for analgesia or anti-inflammation. There should be no need for any dedicated anti-inflammatory agents or analgesics at all in the Resistant Malignancy, Convalescent or Remission Phases. Avoid combining any mutually incompatible treatments.<br />\n8. IMMUNE STIMULATORS \u2013 DHEA, HGH, Clinoptilolite (Zeolite), Artemisinin with Transferrin, Poly-MVA, Mannans, Glucans, Fructans, Lignans, Peptides like Tuftsin or Rigin, Interferon, Interleukins, Selenium, Germanium and many other agents capable of boosting the Immune System or supplementing it may be used throughout the treatment and beyond, excluding agents that are incompatible with Acetogenins during the Late Phase. Aloe, Asteraceae; Amaranthaceae; ABM, Maitake, Reishi, Shiitake, Coriolus &amp; PSK Mushrooms; and a host of other botanical species are excellent immunomodulators. Far Infrared (FIR) therapy also mobilises the Immune System. Zeolite, although an extremely effective immune booster and cell cycle arresting apoptogen, is not recommended for use in conjunction with other cytotoxic agents during the two Malignancy (Mid &amp; Late) Phases because it is a Detox agent and may remove those other agents. Therefore, it is either used in isolation during the Sensitive Malignancy and not at all in the Resistant Malignancy Phase due to Acetogenin incompatibility, or reserved entirely unto other treatment Phases. Throughout all other Phases, Zeolite is a superlative choice. Clinoptilolite (Zeolite) can produce total cancer cures in its own right. If you are of advanced age and your natural DHEA &amp; HGH levels are low, you should meditate daily, or seriously consider lifetime Hormone Replacement Therapy, because there is a correlation between low DHEA &amp; HGH levels and degraded immunity. Another excellent choice is Pueraria Mirifica and related species of White and Red Kwao Krua or their principal active constituent, the magical Sterol called Deoxymiroesterol. Gotu Kola (Indian Pennywort) is also extremely beneficial. Meditation is actually the best means of enhancing DHEA, HGH, ATP and Acetyl Choline production.<br />\n9. NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULATORS \u2013 Selenium in very small doses (trace amounts only \u2013 too much is dangerous), Poly-MVA, CoQ10, Cowhage herb (Mucuna Pruriens), Kwao Krua (Pueraria Mirifica) and other agents that can help to boost Nervous System function may not directly address the cancer itself. However, at a holistic level, it must be appreciated that the Central Nervous System pretty much governs all bodily functions; in concert with the autonomous roles of DNA and RNA at the cellular level. Keeping its function as nearly optimal as possible and also keeping a good frame of mind and spirit are important factors for maximising success against cancer. Meditation is an exceedingly powerful tool that really must be included \u2013 it boosts nervous function to astounding levels, produces countless beneficial cascade effects throughout the body, including the Immune System; and has absolutely no bad side effects or drug incompatibilities. Allowing for incompatibilities, especially with Acetogenins, CNS stimulation treatments should be applied throughout the treatment \u2013 some beyond.<br />\n10. CELL DIFFERENTIATORS \u2013 DMSO, MSM, Vitamins A &amp; D, Alsihum or others that are listed in the Cell Differentiating Agents List are used to induce multiplying cells to mature and eventually cease dividing. This will return a small percentage of them to marginally normal function and render another percentage of them benign and unable to continue multiplying. Antineoplaston peptides are powerful differentiators and also function as selective gene switches. Some differentiating agents like EGCG or Boswellic Acids work by inhibiting production or actuation of agents involved in anti-apoptosis, antidifferentiation and/or cellular proliferation, such as VEGF, NF-Kappa-\uf062, EGF-R, IGF-1 and 5-LPO \u2013 these are substances that are variously overexpressed in cancer tissues and make trouble. This therapy applies mainly to PCCs, NRCCs and CSCs. It is also useful during the healing stage in low doses, both to promote maturation of healthy stem cells for tissue repair and hedge against the possibility that any of those stem cells may unexpectedly lose their maturation mechanisms to become CSCs. Contreras Hospital appears to call this treatment Cell Signal Transduction Therapy. The OCC and OCF protocols are DMSO-based and considered extremely effective, so one of these may be a very good option in this treatment component. They are geared to increase dosages slowly (normally over a period of ten days) in order to allow the patient&#8217;s tolerance of DMSO to improve. Oxidative agents such as O3  inhaled from an air ozonator, or MSM and H2O2 when taken orally in dilute daily doses, will help to induce cellular differentiation and DMSO is also taken orally by some people in the same fashion. That can be augmented with Chlorine Dioxide, which apparently binds to DMSO, to the effect that it is potentiated in the cancer cells by nearly a thousand times. DMSO will induce production of endogenous antioxidants, as will any other oxidative agents, including Chlorine Dioxide. DMSO-based therapies can often produce total cancer cures in their own rights. So can Burzynski&#8217;s Antineoplastons. Early to Mid Phase and Very Late to Remission Phase. May be used in Late Phase if there are no incompatibilities.<br />\n11. ELECTROMEDICAL \u2013 1. Long wave infrared heat called FIR is a hyperthermic therapy with multiple effects. The primary effect is heating tissues to fever level (preferably localised to one area at a time, but can be used system-wide) to that temperature above which malignant cells cannot survive \u2013 42oC. In this stream, it is a cytotoxic therapy and must be used with restraint. It is also in effect a re-energising therapy and immune system therapy; and further, it assists the detox process. 2. Other electromedical technologies may be used as equivalents of Infrared radiation or for a wider range of applications: The Rife Frequency Generator or Lakhovsky Multiwave Oscillator is either sonic or pulsed current; the Rife Beam Ray Machine or Rife-Bare Machine is scalar wave pulsed electromagnetic, the GEIPE is DC current, the PainSolv PEMFT is pulsed electromagnetic, the Lyman-Kaali-Beck system is alternating current at about 4 Hz and the MicroDoctor MCEPT is pulsed current. They operate differently, but generally achieve the same results as the infrared devices, plus several additional capabilities particular to their own modalities of operation. Similar cautions apply. PainSolv and MicroDoctor are not actually designed for direct cancer treatment and are probably limited to indirect adjuvant treatments, such as anti-inflammation, detox, arthritis, tendonosis, muscular complaints, tinitus and so on. All the others are more directly active against microbes and malignancies. Electromedical treatments such as with Beam Ray or Rife-Bare machines can produce total cures in their own rights. Rife Beam Ray Machine treatment used on a small cohort of 16 trial patients (of terminal status) represents the only instance in medical history known to me, where a 100% cure was ever claimed. This occurred at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla circa 1950. Whether completely true or not, Electromedicine is nevertheless very potent and ample proof exists to support this, including a large number of microscopic view video clips on YouTube. Stabilisation, Sensitive, Resistant and Convalescent Phases. Electromedicine may be used to very good effect as a component of the Emergency Treatment Strategy. Restraint is required in the use of all electromedical devices in their respectively applicable Phases, because the effects of these are usually very potent and their use can be overdone quite easily \u2013 to the patient\u2019s considerable detriment. They are not harmless toys and are only safe when used correctly. Medical supervision is recommended for localised infrared treatments, while system-wide infrared administration imperatively requires medical supervision, strict adherence to instructions or plenty of good experience and judgement. Medical supervision is also recommended with some of the other electromedical devices and there are some specific applications to which using certain types of device should never be attempted. Applying pulsed or DC electric currents across the heart or brain is one example \u2013 don\u2019t do it.<br />\n12. POTENTIATORS \u2013 DMSO, Insulin, Transferrin, Piperine, Chavicine, Acetogenins or other Potentiators can be used to enhance transport and specificity of Differentiating or Apoptogenic agents to PCCs, CSCs, MDRCs and NRCCs, thereby maximising bioavailability to cancer cells and minimising harmful side effects; OR they can selectively retard the metabolism or efflux functions that malignant cells use to defend themselves against anticarcinomics and thereby maximise their effectiveness by forcing increased levels of retention. Selectively used throughout the treatment except perhaps the Late Phase, exercising attention to incompatibilities. DMSO, Insulin and in some circumstances other potentiators require administration by qualified medical staff.<br />\n13. REDUCTION-OXIDATION \u2013 Ozone as in Preconditioning O3-AHT, H2O2-AHT, DMSO, MSM, Perftec or other Oxygen carriers are highly antagonistic towards anaerobic cancer cells, which comprise the majority of non-refractory cancer cells. Ozone is incompatible with Acetogenins and so is Hydrogen Peroxide, whilst both can be dangerous if too much is directly infused in-vivo, so in both these cases, special measures must be used to avoid the toxicity and ROS damage to healthy tissues. That is why Ozone or Hydrogen Peroxide is administered ex-vivo to extracted blood, then reinfused to the circulation via IV. Direct blood infusion must be in low concentrations. Hydrogen Peroxide can be taken orally in concentrations between 0.08% and 1% to excellent effect with complete safety. Some people use 3% with no ill effect. It MUST consist of H2O2 and distilled water ONLY. Use only Food Grade 35% or 50% H2O2 and Distilled Water to prepare the dilutions. There must be no stabilising compounds or other additives present in the solution at all. Oxidative therapy is also strongly antibacterial, antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and anticarcinomic. Further, it boosts the Immune System and can often produce total cure in its own right. Vitamin C &amp; K3 intravenous megadosing will generate H2O2 within the cancerous tissues, which in turn releases ROS into them in a much safer manner and AHT is the safest way to put Ozone or H2O2 directly into the blood. There is also a synthetic Oxygen carrier called Perftec that offers great promise in this role. Another oxidative therapy is Chlorine Dioxide. As with Hydrogen Peroxide, Chlorine Dioxide can be self-administered at home, provided it is prepared and used correctly. MSM can also be used orally at home, keeping in mind that dosages must adhere to the safe buildup principle. There are additional Reduction treatments, which are the reverse of Oxidation treatments and which may therefore be used to achieve balance or reverse problematic conditions induced by oxidation. These mainly comprise antioxidants such as CoQ10 or Flavonoids like Hispidulin. Treatments of these kinds are employed by Contreras Hospital and are called Redox Therapies, though Contreras doctors may no longer include DMSO in their therapies as they once did in Mexico. Early to Mid Phase; using Acetogenin-compatible agents only during Late Phase. If warranted, these may also be used in the Convalescent (Very Late) Phase. Ozone, H2O2, DMSO, ClO2, Perftec, intravenous and possibly other treatments of a similar kind require administration by qualified medical staff, though H2O2 strictly of the food grade can be ingested orally in concentrations ranging from 0.08% up to peak therapeutic doses of 1% x one 7 fluid ounce (200 ml) glass thrice daily, one hour before meals. Some people ingest it at 3% strength without harm, but they&#8217;re experienced with their stores of endogenous antioxidants already at peak levels and have adapted to the strong bleach-like taste. Oxidative therapies have an energising effect, so they also qualify for use in the following therapy component. Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, DMSO, MSM and similarly, Chlorine Dioxide can produce total cures in their own rights.<br />\n14. RE-ENERGISING TREATMENT \u2013 ATP, Ubiquinone CoQ10, DHEA, HGH, Glutathione, Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide and several Amazon plants with tonic properties can be used to re-energise the body\u2019s tissues, assist in cell differentiation and reduction of PCC or NRCC tumour mass, provided Acetogenins are not in use. ATP &amp; CoQ10 may help MDRCs to thrive and better defend themselves, so these are best used only in Early to Mid Phase, before MDRCs are likely to become a problem; before dedicated MDRC &amp; MDRM treatment is commenced in Late Phase; and possibly during Very Late Phase. ATP, HGH &amp; CoQ10 may also be used to reduce or even rescue neurological side effects from over-zealous use of Acetogenins, but at an effectiveness cost against the Acetogenins. N-Acetyl-Cysteine and possibly other Amino Acids can be used to very similar rescuing effect. Therefore, NAC is otherwise also incompatible with Acetogenins in normal circumstances. It is further likely to apply to other Amino Acids, such as L-Arginine, which should normally be reserved for the Early and possibly Very Late and Remission Phases \u2013 not Mid or Late Phases. Meditation is also powerfully beneficial in this element of treatment and can be used throughout the entire treatment. Except for Meditation, re-energising treatments are not applied during the Resistant Malignancy Phase, since elevating cellular energy levels is conducive to encouraging MDRCs to thrive. Voltage potentials supported by ATP are the key to this.<br />\n15. ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS \u2013 NaHCO3, H2O2, Ozone, DMSO, MSM, several Amazon plants or similar to eliminate fungal pathogens such as yeasts, especially C. Albicans, Parapsilosis, Tropicalis, Dublinensis &amp; Glabrata. Flavonoids, Terpenoids and Acetogenins are also useful and certain polysaccharides like Glucans, Mannans, Lignans or Fructans will assist against yeasts by regulating sugars (and other mechanisms) in the gastro-intestinal tract. Several plants are documented in Cancer\u2019s Answers that exhibit superlative fungus &amp; yeast killing properties. Electromedicine such as Rife technology may also be used, but Candida species are especially resilient, which means that Rife Machine treatments must be administered once each few days over a period of several weeks to yield fully satisfactory results. Against aggressive disseminated Candida, Rife or GEIPE technology and Acetogenins probably offer the ONLY definitive elimination solutions. GEIPE technology holds promise against microbes and cancer cells too, because it is steady electrical current at a set voltage that will upset critical electric potentials in the membranes of these cells or microbes. Remember that microbes and cancer cells (especially MDRCs) operate at different electrical potentials than healthy cells. This electric potential consideration relates to anaerobic versus aerobic metabolism and applies likewise with Acetogenins. Fungicide is a key measure used throughout the treatment. Exclude Acetogenins preferably until Late Phase, primarily to avoid dosage &amp; duration-related neurological side effects attributed to at least one Acetogenin (Annonacin) \u2013 it is probable that other Acetogenins may exhibit similar effects; and to avoid Acetogenin incompatibility with Ozone, H2O2 and similar ROS or AOS. I have begun to seek after potential agents that might possibly inhibit key metabolic functions in yeasts or other funghi in similar ways that Acetogenins do in bacteria and cancer cells without inducing concomitant neuropathic effects. I suspect I have found some \u2013 they are certainly very aggressive against yeasts and funghi. H2O2 &amp; Ozone are incompatible with Acetogenins and must be excluded during Late Phase. IV Ozone &amp; H2O2 require administration by qualified medical staff, whether ex-vivo or in-vivo.<br />\n16. ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS \u2013 Berberine, Transferrin, Silver Nitrate, Silver Chloride or Colloidal Silver; Flavonoids, Terpenoids, Acetogenins, Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, Comfrey, several Amazon plants and Rife technology can eliminate bacterial infections such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Helicobacter and other bacteria implicated in cancer causality. They can also deal with other bacterial strains and thereby unburden the Immune System somewhat. This is a key measure used throughout the treatment \u2013 exclude Acetogenins preferably until Late Phase and exclude agents incompatible with Acetogenins during Late Phase.<br />\n17. ANTIPARASITIC AGENTS \u2013 Several of the Amazon plants are eminently suitable in this role and will be listed accordingly in due course. Acetogenins are generally very effective. As with any other antimicrobial components, this component aims to reduce the burden upon the Immune System and in this case to do away with these organisms (Protozoa, worms, etc.) so that they also cannot toxify the body or host and reproduce viruses or bacteria in the patient. This key measure is used throughout the treatment \u2013 exclude Acetogenins preferably until Late Phase and exclude agents incompatible with Acetogenins during Late Phase.<br />\n18. ANTIVIRAL AGENTS \u2013 DMSO, several Amazon plants, Rife technology, Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, MSM, Flavonoids, Terpenoids, Acetogenins and other agents able to destroy or inactivate virii implicated in cancer causality; or which inhibit their replication. Clinoptilolite will cage some virions and remove them from the system, too. The viruses include SCV, HPV, EBV, HSV, BPV, SPV, WDSV, HBV, HCV, HTLV and HIV. This is a key measure used throughout the treatment \u2013 exclude Acetogenins until Late Phase and exclude agents incompatible with Acetogenins during Late Phase.<br />\n19. NRCC CYTOTOXICS (CELL APOPTOGENS &amp; NECROTICS) \u2013 Clinoptilolite, Flavonoids, Terpenoids, Stilbenoids, Alkaloids, Acetogenins, Curcuminoids, Rife technology, Vitamin C &amp; K3 megadosing, heavy Alkali Metal salts, Amygdalin or Laetrile and many other compounds can be used to reduce tumour mass and cancer cell populations mainly comprising NRCCs by inducing them to suicide or by killing them. It may even include some of the latest developments in Electromedicine such as HIFU; or Signal Transduction Therapies, such as D-Baits. This is a key measure used in the Sensitive Malignancy (Mid) Phase, but should always be preceded where possible with non-toxic treatments \u2013 differentiation, immunotherapy, etc.. Preferably exclude Acetogenins until Late Phase, unless the cancer is brain, refractory, very aggressive or very advanced.<br />\n20. BRAIN CANCER TREATMENT \u2013 When the major affliction is brain cancer, agents with the ability to cross the Blood Brain Barrier are necessary from the outset. DMSO, Antineoplastons, Acetogenins, Alsihum and Cannabinoids must be considered the best of these, but DMSO can be used to carry others. Anvirzel, Poly-MVA, Cancell, Entelev, Cantron and Protocel are also Trans-BBB formulations that will serve in this role, but function in a similar manner to Acetogenins. Myrrh, Frankincense, Boswellic Acids and Vitamins A, C, D &amp; K3 should also be considered. Terpenoids are typically BBB transient, too. Many Amazon and other tropical plants are useful. Acetogenins might be avoided in the Early to Mid Phase, provided that other agents are satisfactorily able to reduce non-resistant cancer and microbe populations in the brain. If the cancer is refractory, Acetogenins become the necessary agents with the greatest promise of success. In especially difficult cases involving CSCs in the brain, Acetogenins and Piperine/Chavicine may be used to potentiate the effects and retention of supplementary apoptogens. Antineoplastons also help with resistant brain cancers. THC may be considered worth trying in conjunction with Acetogenins in a supplementary neuroprotective role, but this is an untested procedure that warrants more research and a healthy measure of caution. Early to Late Phase, Acetogenins preferably reserved for Late Phase or used with care for dosage and duration limits or apparent neuropathic effects or substituted in cycles with other BBB-transient agents.<br />\n21. ANTICACHEXIA \u2013 When weight loss is involved, Hydrazine Sulphate or other anticachexic agents that can suppress gluconeogenesis are used to keep body mass and constitution from deteriorating to any stage that deprives the patient of an ability to fight the disease from within. HGH &amp; DHEA are useful choices here, too. Cannabinoids may also serve in this role to some degree, because they improve appetite. That will not rectify the cause of the cachexia, but should alleviate its effects to some degree. Beetroot seems to promote weight gain in cachexic cancer patients and although any actual anticachexic action is not verified, it seems likely and may be worth trying. So are any agents that inhibit VEGF, EGF-R, IGF-1, 5-LPO and especially NF-Kappa-\uf062, such as Boswellic Acids and Clinoptilolite.<br />\n22. BONE RESORPTION INHIBITORS \u2013 When Osteoma or bone-metastasis occurs, or there is a strong risk of bone metastasis as in the case of breast cancer, Odanacatib, Ipriflavone, Osteoprotegerin or one of the Biphosphonates or SERMs can be applied to inhibit cancer proliferation in bone tissue and to prevent bone resorption. Laetrile and Amygdalin are also effective metastasis inhibitors, but they do not specifically inhibit bone resorption. One must be very cautious with Biphosphonates, especially Alendronate and Zoledronate, due to such things as causality of Atrial Fibrillation in the heart, Mandibular Osteonecrosis and a 10 \u00bd year half-life. They stay in the system a very long time. The most potent is Zoledronate. SERMs also have their own side effects and warrant care in their use, but there are natural SERMS that one should expect to be safer to use. These should be tried first, before resorting to other types of agent. Administration of bone resorption inhibitors of any kind must be by qualified medical staff. Clinoptilolite (Zeolite) may offer a means of removing Biphosphonates from the system when their purpose has been served, but that is currently unverified.<br />\n23. LIVER CANCERS \u2013 The Liver processes a huge range of substances, either by breaking them down or by glucuronic conjugation and thereby effectively rendering them inert and water-soluble. These important hepatic functions obviously reduce toxin levels in the body, but they also reduce the range of effective agents that may be expected to work against Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, since if the Liver is going to process them into something less active, they\u2019re hardly any use. Even so, the best possible retention of the liver&#8217;s proper function is absolutely essential. Therefore, one cannot expect any inhibition of its function to be satisfactory just for the sake of protecting various cytotoxic agents from being metabolised by the liver. Another approach is necessary. Use Carqueja, or related Asteraceae that contain Hispidulin, because this Flavonoid is a fabulous Liver protective and antitoxin \u2013 probably one of the best in existence. Whole extract of Carqueja is even better. Boswellic Acids, complex Saccharides from Japanese mushrooms, Aloe, Thistles, Andrographis, Dandelion, Sunflower and other plants will help. 80% of Liver Cancers are caused by Hepatitis B &amp; C viruses, but metastasis in the Liver also occurs from cancers of other types and any of these cancers are very aggressive and highly lethal when they damage the Liver sufficiently to stop it processing toxins. This indicates that antiviral agents should be employed that can get into the Liver without being neutralised themselves and likewise, any other active agents being employed in the treatment of Liver Cancer. Oxidative agents such as Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, DMSO, MSM or Chlorine Dioxide are again excellent for this purpose. I have several virulent Amazon plants listed that are very active in the Liver as protectives, tonics, antivirals, hepatic detoxifiers and anticarcinomics, so these should definitely be considered as preferred choices, perhaps sequenced rather than simultaneously, depending on their particular modes of action. These agents do get into the Liver and remain active. Consider Acetogenins for up to a month, regardless of Phase, because these are antiviral as well as anticarcinomic and are very well suited against aggressive cancers. Liver cancers are so serious and prognosis is generally so poor (close to 100% mortality) that resorting to Acetogenins regardless of Treatment Phase may be entirely justified. Rife or HIFU Technology is also worth using as transabdominal signals and are quite readily applied in the zone of the Liver. Infrared radiation for very short periods also offers promise. Clinoptilolite engages liver cancers directly by G-phase apoptogenic action, but in addition, it chelates, adsorbs and removes systemic toxins via kidneys and alimentary tract without need of the liver&#8217;s conjugative detoxification functions. Therefore, it additionally unburdens the liver. Oxidative agents, particularly Ozone or Hydrogen Peroxide, are very beneficial in treating the Liver because they boost mitochondrial activity and liver function in general; and are also strongly anticarcinomic, antiviral and antimicrobial. Cannabinoids are not quickly or easily processed by the Liver and yet are strongly anticarcinomic, so Marijuana is a very good choice against Liver Cancer.<br />\n24. PROTECTIVES &amp; RESCUES \u2013 Curcumin with Piperine, CoQ10, Flavonoids, Cannabinoids, Zeolite, NAC, DHEA, HGH, St. John&#8217;s Wort, Salicylic Acid, Boswellic Acids, Hispidulin, probiotic cultures, several Amazon plants and other agents protect various organs or systems including Liver, Digestive System, Circulatory System, Immune System and Nervous System. Curcumin is a DNA protective and an anticarcinomic. Piperine is its Potentiator. Coenzyme Q10 is a neuroprotective, neurostimulator and ATP production stimulator. THC and various other Cannabinoids are powerful nervous system protectives and regeneratives, with potent anticarcinomic properties, as well. There are several Liver protectives, such as Inulin, Laevulin (Dandelion, Sunflower &amp; other plants), Lentinan or Grifolan (Maitake, Reishi &amp; Shiitake) and all these polysaccharides plus similar Mannans and Lignans are also potent immunomodulators. Hispidulin (a Flavonoid from Carqueja) is a superlative hepatoprotective, antihepatotoxic, detox &amp; antidote agent that is always worth using for toxic syndrome rescue. It neutralises an impressive range of poisons and has a particular affinity with the Liver. St. John&#8217;s Wort increases the rate at which the Liver processes toxins, so it&#8217;s a very useful adjuvant. Zeolite has broad corollary protective and rescue effects through its detoxifying and immune modulating actions. Salicylic Acid (White Willow bark) inhibits NF-Kappa-\uf062 activation and it has additional cardioprotective properties. So does Aspirin, but is much less safe than Salicylic Acid or Salsalate. Rutin, Quercetin and other select Flavonoids are good protectors of various organs and tissues, including the Liver. Any of the Kwao Krua species containing Deoxymiroesterol and other similar sterols offer excellent protective potential and Gotu Kola (Indian Pennywort) is very useful. Protectives may be selectively used throughout the overall treatment, except those incompatible with Acetogenins during Late Phase. Rescues should not be required in most cases where treatments have been administered correctly, but may otherwise be used if problems do require them. They may also be applied to help undo damage done by some of the more brutal orthodox chemotherapy or radiation treatments, or to precondition before using chemo or radiotherapy. Cannabis, ATP, CoQ10, NAC, HGH and other Essential Amino Acids may be used to reduce adverse neural effects of Acetogenins, for example. Curcumin (from Turmeric) is very good against mutagenic agents, including radiation; and Piperine will potentiate its retention. Myrrh and Frankincense also exhibit antimutagenic or other protective influences and some Amazon plants do likewise.<br />\n25. MDRCs &amp; MDRMs \u2013 Acetogenins are preferably used to decisively eliminate Multi-Drug-Resistant Cells, Multi-Drug-Resistant Microbes and other surviving cancerous entities of most types in the Late Phase, when tumour mass and general infections are reduced as realistically far as possible by other means. Entelev, Cancell and Protocel are also effective against resistant cancers in varying degrees by cancer type, because they interfere with ATP production and therefore have very similar effects to Acetogenins. Berberine or any of its several source plants do the same. Rotenone is another, but is largely untested and may exhibit other toxic effects. They may be assisted by microbicides like Transferrin, Colloidal Silver, Sodium Bicarbonate, or certain Amazon plants. Acetogenins and some Amazon plants will also deal effectively with Protozoa, which in some instances may be present and playing host to viruses or other microbes, or engaging the body&#8217;s leucocyte defenses \u2013 the macrophages, B, T and NK cells. Extract from Paw Paw is excellent, since it is readily available (except in Australia, where it is unavailable from within). It has 20 or more extremely potent Acetogenins \u2013 the incredibly powerful Bullatacin, Asiminocin, Asimicin, Asimilobin and Trilobacin, plus Asiminecin, Asiminicin, Bullatetrocin, Bullatin &amp; Bullanin, over 40 more Acetogenins and many other additional phytochemicals. Paw Paw&#8217;s Acetogenins are not currently cited to cause neurodegeneration explicitly, suggesting it is preferable to Graviola or Annonacin \u2013 in any case, Paw Paw is at least 24 times more potent as a cancer cocktail than Graviola. But possible neuropathy is implicit, since course duration limits still apply to Paw Paw and indeed it&#8217;s so with any Acetogenins. I say again that Paw Paw is NOT available from within Australia, but Graviola herb can be imported. What is called Paw Paw in Australia is actually Papaya, which is not related and does not contain Acetogenins. Exclude incompatible agents such as CoQ10, ATP &amp; NAC. Non-Nitrogenous Biphosphonates may be useful in treating resistant bone cancers, because they block FPPS. This is the Late Phase treatment, but when the cancer is refractory, it should also be applied in Early &amp; Mid Phase. Acetogenins can be used efficaciously in earlier phases of the treatment, but attention must be given to incompatibilities and alertness to possible neural effects. To reduce dependency on Acetogenins when combating multi-drug-resistance, try Alsihum, Cantron, Protocel and Myrrh as supplements or as time-cyclic replacements. Curcuminoids and Piperine should be very useful here. Cannabis (THC and other Cannabinoids) may be considered good neuroprotectives and regeneratives for use in conjunction with Acetogenins \u2013 incompatibility is not initially indicated \u2013 but this is not verified, so close observation is required to ensure decisive efficacy against resistant populations, even if it means foregoing suggested protective measures and resorting to neural restoration in the Very Late Phase. This is a discretionary principle. If Acetogenins actually do cause appreciable neural trouble; or if the efficacy of Acetogenin treatment is only marginally impaired by use of a protective; or if the protective is effective in its role without causing a critical compromise in the eventual and timely elimination of resistant cell or microbe populations, then Cannabis may indeed be applied judiciously.<br />\n26. CSCs &amp; LECSCs \u2013 As powerful as Acetogenins are, there are some lines of Cancer Stem Cell such as one MCF-7/Wild Type variant that exhibit limited resistance to them and upon which the Acetogenins have a cytostatic effect (killing some and preventing the survivors from proliferating, but without reducing their population very significantly) rather than a cytotoxic effect. In order to deal successfully with Acetogenin-static populations such as these, the continued use of cell differentiating agents such as Vitamins A &amp; D or Antineoplastons are recommended to force CSC populations to differentiate. In the presence of cytotoxins, this may well result in generation of MDRCs, but those are eradicated readily enough by the Acetogenins. Undifferentiated CSCs may remain as a latent problem that can flare up again when treatment is ultimately discontinued, if they are not also differentiated or eradicated successfully. Once having reduced a CSC population to the minimum possible degree without recourse to Acetogenin-static cell lines, it is then recommended to use additional potentiating agents such as Piperine and Chavicine to further retard CSC metabolism below that level achieved by the Acetogenins in order to deal with stem cells of very slow metabolism. These may be designated as LECSCs \u2013 Low Energy CSCs that don&#8217;t multiply much (more or less dormant, unlike active CSCs) and therefore have low energy requirements. Low energy requirement enables them to survive in ATP depleted environments, but like dormant Stem Cells, they can activate at later dates. These Alkaloids from Piper Nigrum have very good transport protein inhibiting effects, making them highly useful against resistant populations and they additionally potentiate the effects of many other agents by increasing their internal retention \u2013 especially Curcumin from Turmeric. Acetogenins have this effect, too, so using other cytotoxic agents in conjunction with them is very useful at this stage of treatment. Other potentiators such as DMSO should also prove very useful. These are used in conjunction with selected synergistic apoptogens, which owing to the action of Acetogenins and Piperine/Chavicine, are retained in the CSCs without being either expelled or metabolised quickly enough to protect themselves from being induced to apoptosis. Piperine and Chavicine are especially well known for potentiating Curcumin, a very good cancer apoptogen; likewise other anticarcinomic agents. Curcumin is also an antimutagenic DNA protector. It&#8217;s a very good combination to use either after Acetogenin treatment, or in conjunction with Acetogenins. Laetrile or Amygdalin is ideal against stem cells and is highly synergistic with DMSO, so it should do excellent work against CSCs. Alsihum, Myrrh and Cannabinoids should again demonstrate usefulness in the final elimination of these more difficult CSCs and there are a lot of other worthy choices, especially among the Amazon plants. Immunomodulators are also very strongly recommended in this stage of treatment, since when the Immune System is suitably stimulated, it can be relied upon to clean up the last malignant survivors. Rife and similar technologies have excellent utility against CSCs and LECSCs \u2013 well, against just about anything, actually. Except for Rife technologies, which can stand alone if a skilled medical practitioner is on hand to apply them, these are acetogenic adjuvancies applied in the Resistant Malignancy (Late) Phase. These must exclude Clinoptilolite (Zeolite) in this Phase, which should be used in the following Convalescent (Very Late) and Remission Phases instead, because it is a Detox Agent that would remove all manner of cytotoxins from the system, including those being used against the CSC population. It is therefore not desirable in the Sensitive or Resistant Malignancy Phases.<br />\n27. PREGNANCY \u2013 This is a special treatment modality that must be adopted if treating a gestating mother for cancer, because the welfare of the baby is also at stake. Most cancer treatment modalities are cytotoxic or antiproliferative in nature, such that they will harm the baby&#8217;s development. Therefore, the modalities used must be those that are baby-safe and non-teratogenic and if ANY antiproliferative agents are used at all, they MUST be totally selective (targeted) to malignant cells only. As of April 4th, 2012, I have not fully researched the pregnant mother consideration and all the likely suitable treatments. This Component was only just added to the PICTS model at this time, so work remains to be done. The Oxygenating Therapies such as Vitamin C Megadosing, Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide should be considered safe and likewise the Budwig Diet, Bill Henderson Protocol, Rife &amp; FIR Technology. Clinoptilolite should also be considered completely safe, because although it causes cell cycle arrest at either or both G phases, its cycle arresting action is totally selective to malignant cells and does not arrest the cycles of healthy stem cells at all. This is evidenced by the fact that Clinoptilolite does not cause loss of hair, nor any form of cytopenia in patients using it in cancer treatment. Furthermore, it will reduce or even eliminate the baby&#8217;s inheritance of Mercury from the mother. In this case, because cytotoxins are generally not to be administered to pregnant mothers, Clinoptilolite may be used in both malignancy phases. There will probably be immunological considerations that warrant special care in pregnancy cases, too. Bear in mind that the baby, due to paternal DNA, is a foreign entity to the mother, so Trophoblasts, Human Chorionic Gonadotrophins and selective suppression of the mother&#8217;s immune response become relevant in the context of the baby&#8217;s protection. If suitably baby-safe treatments fail to arrest resistant cancers, then the Resistant Malignancy Phase must be delayed if possible until the baby can be delivered.  Applicable to gestating mothers right throughout the period of concurrent pregnancy and cancer treatment \u2013 inclusive of all adjuvant and supplementary treatments.<br />\n28. REGENERATION \u2013 This is healing and regeneration of tissues, organs, systems and general constitution, particularly where either cancer or administration of harmful orthodox treatment methods (chemo, surgery and radiotherapy) have damaged or destroyed them. Holistic treatments are very important in this, while there are many natural agents known to stimulate general regeneration \u2013 Start with the Oxidative agents already mentioned \u2013 Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide, etc.. Add Comfrey, Cats Claw, Valerian, Gotu Kola, Aloe Vera or Aloe Arborescens and a host of Amazon plants. Most are also anticarcinomics and antimicrobials, while THC is an excellent neural regenerator. DHEA, HGH and CoQ10 are very valuable in this role and I believe Pueraria Mirifica, Pueraria Montana or Butea Superba will help, too. Holistics are perpetual, while the use of Comfrey, Cats Claw and other regenerative plants or agents can be multiphase, but preferably Very Late and Remission Phases, after MDRC treatment with Acetogenins and adjuvant CSC treatments. Comfrey is a proliferative healer and therefore incompatible with antiproliferatives of any sort, including Acetogenins. Cannabis or THC can be used more widely. It is a strong anticarcinomic and is able to cross the Blood Brain Barrier. Acetogenins are not ideal for this Component. Clinoptilolite (Zeolite) is strongly recommended as a Regenerative Agent because it modulates Immune System activity (therefore healing) and because Detox (with mineral supplementation) definitely helps regeneration and recovery in the Convalescent (Very Late) and Remission Phases.<br />\n29. COMPLETION \u2013 This is the Remission (Final) Phase; an extended period of treatment using largely preventive measures including diet, detox, microbiome, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, healing and immune boosting treatments, with regular monitoring of the condition using pathology and other diagnostic methods \u2013 mainly through outpatient clinical services. It should last at least twelve months and the continuing detox program may easily last longer. Do not become complacent because you might feel fully recovered, or because pathology tests show the &#8220;all clear&#8221;. If you are fortunate enough to be involved with institutions like Contreras, there may be an ongoing relationship with your specialist, the hospital and support network \u2013 even in perfect health \u2013 for life. Where cancer is concerned, that&#8217;s a desirable amenity to have at your disposal.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5850\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5850\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5850\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 13, 2013 at 8:37 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5850#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5850\", \"5850\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Where do you deem up this shit ???<br />\n&#8221; suddenly drop dead&#8221; from b12 deficiency ???

Those mentioned include the most prominent and a select few particularly and repeatedly so, not only for their efficacy, but their versatility. They are mentioned again and again, like a recurring theme. If you check the lists of plants and biochemicals in the Appendices, you&#8217;ll find significant numbers of beneficial agents with their properties. Some good product sources on the internet are Raintree.com and Nature\u2019s Sunshine.com, but there are many others. Fusion is a very good Australian supplements brand with a quite respectable range of natural products based strongly on TCM. I now have reliable Australian suppliers of almost 100 types of dried herb and related natural health products called Accolent \u2013 find this vendor on eBay; and New Directions at <a href=\"http://www.newdirections.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newdirections.com.au</a>. If the source is internet-based, test the source\u2019s reliability in delivering the product with a small-scale purchase using a debit card (after ensuring that if delivery is via international mail, your country&#8217;s customs service will allow its importation). The debit card should have only a sufficient balance to cover the purchase. Avoid using any card that allows you a line of credit. These are too easily fingered by unscrupulous hackers and cybercrime is on the increase.</p>\n<p>March 6th, 2010: Following an email request to Contreras (Oasis Of Hope) Hospital for information on cancer cure stats and treatment regimes, I received a book from them authored by Fransisco Contreras MD and Daniel E. Kennedy MC. Statistics provided were very simple and basic, but show a clear and definite pattern of profound superiority over any kind of non-augmented conventional chemotherapy. The book is titled, &#8220;HOPE \u2013 Medicine &amp; Healing&#8221;. What an excellent book! I came to understand why such stats were bare and basic. More importantly, I was given insight into a fully integrated cancer treatment philosophy VERY, VERY SIMILAR to that which I had already devised and set down here under these Chapter Two HICS headings, &#8220;Fundamental Treatment Principles&#8221;; &#8220;Phases In A Cancer Treatment Strategy&#8221;; and &#8220;PICTS \u2013 Phased Integrative Cancer Treatment Strategy&#8221;. It came as a surprise, for I\u2019d previously believed Contreras used a rather more ad hoc range of protocols, including DMSO-Laetrile.</p>\n<p>The components of my own integrative cancer treatment system are as described above and in what follows. They are embraced collectively under what I call the Holistically Integrated Cancer Strategy.</p>\n<p>Too few cancer treatment protocols (and none known to me in orthodox oncology) are fully integrated approaches to cancer treatment. Most are therefore inherently defective. Consequently, I was greatly heartened to learn that SOMEBODY out there is actually practising a variant of what I preach in Cancer&#8217;s Answers. The Oasis Of Hope version is called IRT \u2013 Integrative Regulatory Therapy. It supersedes what I previously believed Contreras to have been doing in cancer treatment. I have also since discovered that there are several other institutions besides Oasis Of Hope that provide Integrative Cancer Therapies. It&#8217;s a good sign and clearly points the direction in which cancer therapy must evolve in future.</p>\n<p>I also learned a bit more about some particular details of cancer treatment that were too good to overlook, so I appropriately added another modification to my PICT Strategy as a pre-eminent extension of the &#8220;Oxygen Treatment&#8221; and &#8220;Protectives &amp; Rescues&#8221; items already listed, plus some extra information to two or three other small items. The new major Item is called &#8220;Preconditioning&#8221;. So, I have Contreras to thank for some significant improvements.</p>\n<p>Contreras strategies don&#8217;t appear to overtly attack the microbe aspects of cancer causality as I advocate; and indeed, the book doesn&#8217;t even mention microbes in the cancer context. But the funny thing is that it doesn&#8217;t matter too much. Their strategies are so similar to mine, that they actually do address microbial infection issues as a perfectly natural matter of course. The system of treatments they employ cannot fail to do this.</p>\n<p>Oasis Of Hope does not yet appear to have embraced the use of Acetogenins, Berberine, Myrrh or some other natural agents, but does have approaches designed to overcome multi-drug resistance via resensitisation. I suspect they&#8217;re not quite as good as Acetogenins, but they are unquestionably more effective than typical orthodox treatments in this regard and it is a critical element of success in cancer treatment. Contreras doctors are very progressive in their thinking, however; and even quite legitimately redefine &#8220;success&#8221; in cancer treatment. So I have a feeling they may well integrate Acetogenins into their therapies in future and possibly even embrace the microbial aspects more deliberately, too.</p>\n<p>There is one particular area in which the doctors at Contreras and I disagree. That is in believing that no natural anticarcinomic compounds are as potent as the orthodox ones for regressing tumour masses. Consequently, Contreras selectively uses orthodox chemo agents coupled with protective agents and potentiators to achieve the predominant tumour regression. I maintain that there ARE such powerful natural anticarcinomic agents, though they do not act as swiftly as the orthodox agents. Of course, these are the Acetogenins. One of these (Bullatacin) is 1,000 million (a billion) times more potent than Adriamicin for a couple of cell lines, including Prostate. Two more (Asiminocin and Trilobacin) are a million million (a trillion) times more potent than Adriamicin, again for certain specific cell lines. All three are found in natural North American Paw Paw.</p>\n<p>As far as I&#8217;m aware, the ONLY orthodox chemo drugs approaching this kind of potency are some of the Platinum drugs \u2013 notably Triplatin Tetranitrate. However, almost ALL of the Platins are dangerously toxic \u2013 they just don&#8217;t have a satisfactory safety profile to go with their potency. In any case, all Platin drugs have another serious weakness, because for all their cytotoxic potency, they can&#8217;t beat MDRCs without causing collateral destruction that is far too massive to the point of literally being lethal to the patient. Orthodox TKI or CDKI drugs are actually much better in that particular respect, but Acetogenins are still far superior!</p>\n<p>This is the area in which Contreras Hospital would do better \u2013 by adopting the use of Acetogenins and augmenting that with the use of the Curcumin &amp; Piperine combination, plus a select few other agents like Berberine, Entelev, Cancell or Protocel and perhaps even Antineoplastons. In doing so, erstwhile difficulties so often experienced in treating multi-drug resistant cancers will be dramatically reduced, if not eliminated. It is fortunate for people in North America that Paw Paw is easily available, since it is native to that continent. Australians are currently not so blessed \u2013 Paw Paw seeds and herbal extract products seem to be heavily overshadowed to the point of concealing displacement by a vile marketing strategy involving the misnomenclature of Carica Papaya to masquerade as Paw Paw (Asimina Triloba). I intend to change that unsatisfactory situation, for although Paw Paw dried leaf and stem is actually permitted to pass through Australian Customs, seeds are not. That isn\u2019t the result of corrupt malenforcement of laws supposedly intended to protect the country and its people from noxious plant imports or dangerous drugs as such, but the result of a peculiar combination of subtle quirks involving naming rights of pharmaceutical cartel Papaya products as \u201cPaw Paw\u201d products and government bureaucratic oversight.</p>\n<p>Papaya is an anticarcinomic plant I have largely overlooked to date. That may be unfair, because as I continuously sift through data concerning cancer treatment, interesting little snippets of information do pop up from time to time. Papaya is used as an adjuvant in cancer treatment by at least one Queensland hospital, but that is not what I have recently found to be of interest. Instead, this next thing in my journey of discovery was previously overlooked, even though it was right under my nose, until something in the Black Salve literature triggered a \u201cconnection moment\u201d in my head. That \u201cnext thing\u201d is proteolysis of immune masking proteins by certain enzymatic compounds called \u201cProteases\u201d. Now, there are components in Black Salve which are said to contain these, but it happens that Papaya expresses Papain proteases. Could Papaya exhibit similar unmasking properties to Black Salve and thereby enable immune response against erstwhile disguised cancer cells? Research is ongoing, but if confirmed, then this or perhaps even certain evolutions of Black Salve or Hoxsey tonics may become the cornerstone agents of a new PICTS Component #30 &#8211; \u201cUnmasking Proteases\u201d.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s too soon yet, but we shall see! </p>\n<p>Proteases notwithstanding, where Papaya is otherwise concerned, Big Pharma has been pulling strings again, which is nothing new, but which absolutely must cease and must be reversed. Further, the production and marketing of drugs such as Nitrogen Mustards, Nitrosoureas, Anthracyclines, MABs, rDNAs, Platins, Avandia, Botox, Vioxx, Gardasil, Statins and a host of other filthy crimes against humanity must be outlawed and the progenitors and approvers of them must be prosecuted with utmost prejudice under the Law \u2013 which of course is never going to happen, regardless. These are drugs which have permanently damaged and killed people, some drugs individually into the tens of thousands of fatalities during the last eighty years. Even Acetominophen (Paracetamol) has killed. It&#8217;s the World&#8217;s Number One cause of liver failure and liver failure means death. On a global scale, the collective death toll directly attributable to such drugs runs into the tens of millions. They almost rival cancer itself and are America&#8217;s sixth biggest killer at around 100,000 fatalities annually according to one source, or 160,000 according to another source dated from the early 1990s, without including illicit drug use, but even yet, there is another claim at large that the annual American fatality rate from &#8216;normal drug use&#8217; runs to 600,000. Update: Vioxx and Avandia have been withdrawn from the market! Two down \u2013 hundreds still to go.</p>\n<p>Mexico has also been the centre of pioneering work with an artificial Oxygen carrier called Perftec, mainly due to chronic shortage of donor blood in hospitals \u2013 whereby they were forced to look for a Haemoglobin substitute. The magic substance is an Oxygen chelating Porphyrin like Haemoglobin and has enormous potential in cancer therapy. Contreras uses this agent in its Redox Therapy.</p>\n<p>Contreras is now spearheading change in cancer treatment in the US, having expanded from Mexico and established a hospital in San Diego, California. It is apparently so much so that MSK and NCI are now beginning to change their tunes and are more readily embracing complementary cancer treatments, if not alternative or fully integrated ones that they formerly took every opportunity to discredit.</p>\n<p>It is long overdue.</p>\n<p>I have added a whole new Section devoted to the description of Contreras IRT, based upon the contents of that fine, eloquent little book they sent me in their generosity. In it, I also reflect the great importance Contreras places upon the spiritual component of wellness and indeed the whole outlook based upon FAITH, together with a factual scientific basis for its beneficence. Of course, my belief system is Agnostic, while theirs is classic Christian \u2013 indeed, it is Roman Catholic, but of very enlightened flavour, richly imbued with excellent understanding of Jesus&#8217;s philosophy and teachings. That is very significant, for Jesus was more than Davidian Jew, Gallilean or Nazarene. He was ESSENE, not by birth as most Essenes at Wadi Qumran, Mount Carmel, the Nile Delta and the Himalayas were, but by choice and teaching. He was a Holy Man who travelled widely and learned a great deal \u2013 that included the herbal as well as spiritual healing disciplines practised by the Essenes \u2013 basically, he adopted the Essene ways and fused them with his hereditary Judaism. This is why his teachings were in very sharp contrast to either the orthodox Jewish OR the Roman religious ways of thinking at the time. And Contreras holds true to his vision \u2013 you don&#8217;t need to be religious to appreciate that.</p>\n<p>The new Section G in Chapter Six will enable you to compare Contreras strategies with mine. I trust it will help you to better appreciate the DIFFERENCE that fully integrated cancer therapies such as theirs represent in the treatment of this terrible disease and moreover, the difference they make to people&#8217;s lives in a far broader context than simple medical health alone. It is not to say they have all the answers \u2013 they don\u2019t. Neither do I, unfortunately. It is to say that there is a seriously significant difference for the better when compared with the abysmal performance of orthodox oncology. I am confident that Contreras is going to put America&#8217;s cancer treatment orthodoxy on its complacent, heartless, soulless, greedy, corrupt, parasitic bloody backside; and spearhead the coming of a New Age in oncology. The same may be said of other institutions offering similar integrative therapy regimes \u2013 several of these are now listed in the Directories. I seriously hope similar initiatives will soon burgeon here in Australia; and so much the better if it becomes a global phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Issels Treatment: This is an impressive Integrative Cancer Medicine system which again appears to strongly resemble HICS. A feature of the Issels Treatment is Infrared Therapy and my studies indicate this is an extremely potent and valuable therapy.

The agreement also includes civil penalties for improper marketing of a half-dozen other drugs. The fine against GlaxoSmithKline over Paxil, Wellbutrin, Avandia and the other drugs makes this year a record for money recovered by the federal government under its so-called whistle-blower law, according to a group that tracks such numbers.<br />\nIn May, Abbott Laboratories settled for $1.6 billion over its marketing of the antiseizure drug Depakote. And an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson that could result in a fine of as much as $2 billion is said to be imminent over its off-label promotion of an antipsychotic drug, Risperdal. No individuals have been charged in any of the cases. Even so, the Justice Department contends the prosecutions are well worth the effort \u2014 reaping more than $15 in recoveries for every $1 it spends, by one estimate. But critics argue that even large fines are not enough to deter drug companies from unlawful behavior. Only when prosecutors single out individual executives for punishment, they say, will practices begin to change. \u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that money doesn\u2019t deter corporate malfeasance,\u201d said Eliot Spitzer, who, as New York\u2019s attorney general, sued GlaxoSmithKline in 2004 over similar accusations involving Paxil. \u201cThe only thing that will work in my view is C.E.O.\u2019s and officials being forced to resign and individual culpability being enforced.\u201d The federal whistle-blower law, officially the False Claims Act, dates to 1863 and was originally envisioned as a check on war profiteering after the Civil War. Whistle-blowers get a share of any money recovered by the federal government. So far, according to Patrick Burns, spokesman for the whistle-blower advocacy group Taxpayers Against Fraud, at least $10 billion has been agreed to in settlements this fiscal year, which ends in September. The settlement, which requires court approval, stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.<br />\nProsecutors said the company had tried to win over doctors by paying for trips to Jamaica and Bermuda, as well as spa treatments and hunting excursions. In the case of Paxil, prosecutors claim GlaxoSmithKline employed several tactics aimed at promoting the use of the drug in children, including helping to publish a medical journal article that misreported data from a clinical trial. A warning was later added to the drug that Paxil, like other antidepressants, might increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in teenagers. Prosecutors said the company had marketed Wellbutrin for conditions like weight loss and sexual dysfunction when it was approved only to treat major depressive disorder. They said that in the case of Avandia, whose use was severely restricted in 2010 after it was linked to heart risks, the company had failed to report data from studies detailing the safety risks to the F.D.A. \u201cToday\u2019s multibillion-dollar settlement is unprecedented in both size and scope,\u201d said James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general. \u201cIt underscores the administration\u2019s firm commitment to protecting the American people and holding accountable those who commit health care fraud.\u201d The initial terms of the settlement were announced in November, and Glaxo had already set aside cash for the settlement. In a statement Monday, the company said it has since changed many of its policies, including no longer rewarding sales representatives for the number of drug prescriptions sold. Andrew Witty, the chief executive, sought to portray the illegal actions as part of the company\u2019s past. \u201cWhilst these originate in a different era for the company, they cannot and will not be ignored,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cOn behalf of GSK, I want to express our regret and reiterate that we have learned from the mistakes that were made.\u201d The three criminal charges involved Paxil, Wellbutrin and Avandia and included a criminal fine of $1 billion. The remaining $2 billion involves fines in connection with a civil settlement over the sales and marketing practices of the blockbuster asthma drug Advair and several other drugs. Part of the civil settlement also includes claims that the company overcharged the government for drugs. Glaxo did not admit any wrongdoing in the civil settlement. Despite the large amount, $3 billion represents only a portion of what Glaxo made on the drugs. Avandia, for example, racked up $10.4 billion in sales, Paxil brought in $11.6 billion, and Wellbutrin sales were $5.9 billion during the years covered by the settlement, according to IMS Health, a data group that consults for drugmakers. \u201cSo a $3 billion settlement for half a dozen drugs over 10 years can be rationalized as the cost of doing business,\u201d Mr. Burns said. Mr. Burns and others have said that to institute real change, executives must be prosecuted criminally or barred from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, an action known as \u201cexclusion.\u201d This has occurred in only a handful of cases, and rarely in a case involving a major pharmaceutical company. In 2011, four executives of the medical device company Synthes were sentenced to less than a year in prison for conducting clinical trials that were not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. That same year, the former chief executive of K.V. Pharmaceutical was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $1 million for selling misbranded morphine tablets. The previous year, the Department of Health and Human Services excluded him from doing business with the federal government. Those in the pharmaceutical industry have stressed that the activities revealed in the recent settlements occurred many years ago, and practices have changed radically since then. The Glaxo settlement includes an agreement by the company to withdraw bonuses from top executives if they engaged in or supervised illegal behavior, believed to be a first. \u201cThat creates pressure and it creates an element of responsibility,\u201d said Erika Kelton, who represented two of the four whistle-blowers in the Glaxo case. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good step in the right direction.\u201d\u201d Journalists Katie Thomas &amp; Michael S. Schmidt in the New York Times 2nd July, 2012, quoting New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer; Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole; GSK CEO Andrew Witty; Spokesperson of whistleblower advocacy group Taxpayers Against Fraud, Patrick Burns; and GSK whistleblower Erika Kelton.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5861\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5861\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5861\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 14, 2013 at 4:40 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5861#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5861\", \"5861\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>238. \u201cThe FDA is responsible for 140,000 heart attacks and 60,000 dead Americans. That\u2019s as many people as were killed in the Vietnam War. Yet the FDA points the finger at me and says, \u2018Well, this guy\u2019s a rat, you can\u2019t trust him,\u2019 but nobody is calling them to account. Congress isn\u2019t calling them to account. For the American people, it\u2019s dropped off the radar screen. They should be screaming because this can happen again.\u201d Dr. David Graham, Associate Director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Drug Safety and a whistleblower, said in an interview 2006.</p>\n<p>239. &#8220;&#8230;the agency\u2019s senior management is more concerned with external appearance than rigorous science.&#8221;  Dr. Richard Horton, Editor, The Lancet, referring to FDA.</p>\n<p>240. After reading the Merck insider emails published in the Wall Street Journal showing how Merck sought to distort drug trials to hide evidence of heart disease, and after reviewing the same clinical trials on the drug that the FDA reviewed before approving it, Dr. Horton was outraged and called for FDA reform: \u201cIn the case of Vioxx, the FDA was urged to mandate further clinical safety testing after a 2001 analysis suggested a &#8216;clear-cut excess number of myocardial infarctions&#8217;. It did not do so. This refusal to engage with an issue of grave clinical concern illustrates the agency\u2019s in-built paralysis, a predicament that has to be addressed through fundamental organizational reform.&#8221; But Dr. Horton didn&#8217;t stop there. He also explained, &#8220;&#8230;with Vioxx, Merck and the FDA acted out of ruthless, short-sighted, and irresponsible self-interest.&#8221; Dr. Richard Horton, Editor, The Lancet.</p>\n<p>241. \u201cIn other words, Merck and the FDA were playing the classic &#8220;cover your ass&#8221; game in trying to hide the destructive health consequences of Vioxx from the public for as long as possible. And they managed to pull it off for four years thanks to the gullibility of conventional doctors and the ignorance of the American public, who continue to believe in prescription drugs as &#8220;miracle cures&#8221; for just about every symptom or disease, even though the facts reveal that prescription drugs heal no one. More often than not, they actually kill people.\u201d Mike Adams, Health Ranger Editor of NaturalNews.com.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5862\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5862\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5862\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 14, 2013 at 4:42 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5862#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5862\", \"5862\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>242. Another FDA researcher, Dr. Andrew Mosholder, was censored and not allowed to testify in February, 2004 about his study that found antidepressants increase the risk of suicides in children. There was a war within the FDA between the scientists who recognized the clear health risks of drugs like Prozac and Vioxx, vs. the top administrators who wanted to keep pushing drugs to the public regardless of their health risk. As Dr. David Graham explained, &#8220;The review and clearance process had been turned into a battleground, full of contention and intimidation because our managers, the people who fill out our performance evaluations, had created a system where it was taking a great risk to stand firm in our scientific beliefs.&#8221; Dr. David Graham, Associate Director, FDA Office of Drug Safety and whistleblower, with excerpt from article by Mike Adams, Health Ranger Editor, NaturalNews.com.</p>\n<p>243. \u201cThese actions are not mere &#8220;administrative oversight,&#8221; folks. These actions represent a pattern of criminal behavior on the part of FDA employees and drug company executives. Promoting these toxic drugs, distorting the clinical trials, and burying the negative evidence are criminal actions and should be treated as such. In a sane world, the FBI would march into the FDA offices tomorrow and arrest these white-collar felons for the crimes they have committed. Executives at Merck should do prison time &#8212; plus pay billions in fines &#8212; for the pain, suffering and death they have unleashed upon the population. Quite clearly, Big Pharma is a highly corrupt industry, and it is backed and promoted by a federal agency that needs to be wiped clean and rebuilt from scratch (along with a new office of Internal Affairs that would investigate FDA employees for precisely these sort of crimes). Regardless of what happens next, it&#8217;s evidence that the public trust in the FDA has been destroyed.\u201d Mike Adams, Health Ranger Editor, NaturalNews.com.</p>\n<p>244. &#8220;&#8230;the most important legacy of this episode is the continued erosion of trust that public-health institutions will suffer. Failure to act decisively on signals of risk might minimize short-term political criticism for regulators, or shareholder unrest for company chief executives. But the long-term consequence of prevarication is a tide of public skepticism about just whose interests drug makers and regulators truly represent.&#8221; Dr. Richard Horton, Editor, The Lancet, referring to FDA conduct in lieu of the Vioxx scandal.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5863\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5863\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5863\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 14, 2013 at 4:43 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5863#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5863\", \"5863\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>245. \u201cIn September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of the arthritis drug Bextra for uses unapproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time. Pfizer also paid the U.S. government $1.3 billion in criminal fines related to the &#8220;off-label&#8221; marketing of Bextra, the largest penalty ever rendered for any crime. Called a repeat offender, this was Pfizer&#8217;s fourth such settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in the previous ten years. Access to pharmaceutical industry documents has revealed marketing strategies used to promote Neurontin for off-label use. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer) only for treatment of seizures. Warner\u2013Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used activities not usually associated with sales promotion, including continuing medical education and research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within 5 years the drug was being widely used for the off-label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner\u2013Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses, and paid $430 million to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. Today it is a mainstay drug for migraines, even though it was not approved for such use in 2004. In September 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed four drugs\u2014Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica\u2014&#8221;for non-approved uses; it was Pfizer&#8217;s fourth such settlement in a decade. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., a Pfizer subsidiary, agreed to plead guilty to misbranded promotion of Bextra, a felony violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The criminal fine accounts for $1.3 billion of the settlement, and was the largest criminal penalty imposed in American history until the BP plea agreement for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Pfizer has entered an extensive corporate integrity agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General and will be required to make substantial structural reforms within the company, and maintain the Pfizer website (www.pfizer.com/pmc) to track the company&#8217;s post marketing commitments. Pfizer must also put a searchable database of all payments to physicians the company has made on the Pfizer website by March 31, 2010. In addition, two former employees were separately indicted and sentenced for their role in marketing of Bextra. A former District Sales manager was found guilty of obstruction of justice for destroying documents pertinent to the investigation, and a Regional Sales Manager pled guilty to the distribution of a misbranded product. The case was also the largest civil settlement against a pharmaceutical company as of then.] Pfizer paid a $1 billion civil fine to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and caused false claims to be submitted to Federal and State programs including but not limited to Medicare and Medicaid. Under the False Claims Act, damages can be assessed for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a\u20137b(b) and the off-label marketing provision within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301-97. Six whistle-blowers will receive $102 million for their participation in the civil investigation, and John Kopchinski, a former sales representative, will receive $51.5 million for his allegations involving the marketing of Bextra. According to Harper&#8217;s Magazine publisher John MacArthur, Pfizer withdrew &#8220;between $400,000 and a million dollars&#8221; worth of ads from their magazine following an unflattering article on depression medication.\u201d Wikipedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5864\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5864\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5864\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 14, 2013 at 5:53 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5864#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5864\", \"5864\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>The sheer volume of material I&#8217;ve posted might easily be perceived as overkill. Alas, I am a sinner! In a fit of weakness, I decided the boojum should be shown up and put in its proper place. Now, in an act of contrition (sort of!) I hereby confess that I enjoyed doing it. Well, nobody&#8217;s perfect&#8230;.</p>\n<p>To most of you good folks who visit this site and probably gasp, &#8220;What the&#8230;.&#8221; I express a sincere hope that despite your bemusement, you&#8217;ve been able to derive a useful perspective and information from it that might make a worthwhile difference in your quest for answers to those questions revolving around cancer and even health in a broader context.</p>\n<p>What I posted comprised information in three general streams:</p>\n<p>1. Introduction to a number of pioneer medicos (in cancer and other diseases) and the treatment modalities they developed and used;<br />\n2. A perspective on the commercial and political dynamics operating in the medical/drug industry with its prime epicentre in the USA, plus plenty of incrimination of Big Pharma and the FDA;<br />\n3. Basic cancer causality theory, fundamental medical treatment principles, an Integrative Medicine treatment system for cancer and insight into the utility of a number of treatment modalities and natural substances within the framework of that Integrative Medical System.</p>\n<p>And if I can cap it off by returning to the original theme here, let me please indicate that Black Salve has a legitimate place in the treatment of skin cancers, plus a few other types of malignancy. May I please emphasise yet again however, that one should always engage every possible approach to treating any given kind of cancer &#8211; not any single modality alone. This is consistent with the philosophy that defines the basis of Integrative Medicine. The cornerstones of that philosophy are: &#8220;Treat the whole patient &#8211; not the disease or its symptoms in isolation;&#8221; and &#8220;DO NO HARM&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Best wishes!</p>\n<p>Mad Prof.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5925\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5925\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://I&#039;mafraiditstartedasajokealbeitadangerousone..Thethreadwasnotsupportingorhelpingpeoplewithskincancer.Itstartedwithanunverifiabletalefromanunnamedsourcesupposedlyhavingexperiencedshorttermsurviv' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mdmurray</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5925\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 18, 2013 at 4:27 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5925#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5925\", \"5925\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>What a load of absolute shite .

The condition is extremely painful and causes the victim&#8217;s skin to peel off, exposing raw flesh in the same manner as a third degree burn victim.</p>\n<p>It turned out that the manufacturer, Mutual Pharma, had known about the side effect all along, but had deliberately covered it up.</p>\n<p>Karen Bartlett sued Mutual Pharma in New Hampshire state court, arguing that the drug company included no warning about the possible side effect. A court agreed and awarded her $21 million.</p>\n<p>Now, NINE YEARS LATER, the US Supreme Court has astonishingly OVERTURNED the original verdict and award.</p>\n<p>The judges ruled that all generic drugs and their manufacturers are exempt from liability for side effects, mislabelling or virtually any other negative reactions caused by their drugs, so long as the drugs are made from the exact same formula and carry the exact same warnings as their brand name counterparts.</p>\n<p>The only companies that can now be sued are manufacturers of original &#8216;name brand&#8217; drugs.</p>\n<p>But, when you consider that generic drugs account for over 80 per cent of all drugs prescribed, this ruling provides Big Pharma with a massive incentive to deliberately withhold safety information and to cut corners on monitoring adverse side effects.</p>\n<p>In the US, the FDA has ultimate authority over pharmaceuticals. So, now if the FDA says a drug is safe \u2014 even if that decision is wrong or based on lies, fraud or deception on the part of the worlds&#8217; pharmaceutical companies \u2014 then there&#8217;s no way to sue either the FDA or the pharmaceutical companies for their incompetence, negligence or deception.</p>\n<p>How long before a similar ruling makes its way to the UK and Europe?</p>\n<p>Well, you can bet your mortgage that Big Pharma&#8217;s lobbyists are already stuffing bundles of unmarked Euros into brown paper envelopes to win over the hearts and minds of the lawmakers in Brussels.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5923\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5923\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5923\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 18, 2013 at 10:40 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5923#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5923\", \"5923\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Sanguinaria &#8211; one of the major ingredients in Black Salve:</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a member of the Poppy Family of plants and is rich in alkaloids &#8211; 60-plus, to say nothing of any non-nitrogenous polyphenols or terpenoids.</p>\n<p>Of these, I&#8217;ve managed to get some gen on three of them.</p>\n<p>Berberine (for which Goldenseal, Goldthread and Barberry are better known and yield higher amounts) is a very important one. It is powerfully anticarcinomic and antimicrobial with a principal activity mechanism of Mitochondrial Complex I inhibition &#8211; it acts against Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase. This suppresses the pumping of protons to develop electric potential to create ATP. Long story short, this absolutely qualifies it as being effective against multi-drug-resistant cells and microbes. Berberine is also a systemic tonic/adaptogen, within certain dosage limits.</p>\n<p>Chelerythrine&#8217;s mechanisms of action are less extensively researched and documented. It is a protein kinase c inhibitor and very highly slective, with efficacy against cancer cells and microbes.</p>\n<p>Sanguinarine is much more extensively researched. It occurs in Bloodroot, Greater Celandine and several other plants. This one binds with Complex I to inhibit ATP production in a similar way to Berberine, so again, it&#8217;s effective against malignant cells and microbes via Complex I inhibition and likewise therefore effective against multi-drug resistance. It&#8217;s highly selective and yet exhibits many other actions, starting with the inducement of apoptosis in malignant cells and does likewise with microbes because it also binds with Bacterial Complex I, which is a similar but smaller and simpler proton pump called Ubiquinol Oxidase. For another example, it&#8217;s a potent protein cleaving enzyme, giving fairly strong credence to the unproven theory that it can &#8220;unmask&#8221; cancer cells by destroying the membrane proteins which provide the disguise. There are several protein types it is active against. It also cleaves DNA. In most of its bioactions, its potency is such that very small amounts in the range of 0.1 to 10 Micromoles produces any of several specific effects at up to 100% efficacy. As a bone resorption inhibitor, for instance, it is 100% effective at less than 1 Micromole. When you look at these four properties, you might easily realise that it&#8217;s one of the few highly potent almost-all-round cancer killers and perhaps more significantly, one of the few antiviral agents that works three ways: 1. Indirectly via inhibition of ATP production, it reduces or stops virus reproduction; 2. Directly, it cleaves proteins and therefore viral capsid proteins; 3.Directly, it cleaves viral DNA. These latter two actions clearly mean that it is an active virus destroyer. In laboratory research, it has proven very potent against very long lists of malignant cell lines, bacteria and funghi.</p>\n<p>And these are just three of over 60 alkaloids in Bloodroot. There can be little doubt that when further potentiated by Zinc Chloride and DMSO, as you find in a typical Black Salve, you do indeed have a powerful cancer killer.</p>\n<p>With the science behind it that I have so far found, there equally can be no doubt at all once again (it&#8217;s par for the course, anyway) that the FDA and orthodox medicine aficionados who nay-say Black Salve are either total ignoramuses, or outright liars.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5928\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5928\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6f61cb2d016d205a44789a235f67e11c?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Ju Wau</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5928\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 19, 2013 at 3:08 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5928#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5928\", \"5928\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Ju Wau'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>What goes wrong in nature, nature provides an antidote!</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5932\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5932\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5932\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 5:23 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5932#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5932\", \"5932\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Ju Wau,</p>\n<p>Good observation &#8211; very true.</p>\n<p>To put another spin on it, the biology of this planet has evolved over millions of years in a complex mix of competitive and symbiotic relationships. As new species develop via evolution from their ancestors, they progressively acquire new abilities to survive, either through symbiosis or through defensive mechanisms, yet nevertheless inherit core chemistries from their parent species, just as we humans inherit our ability to produce ATP from a process devised by bacteria between 1 and 1.5 billion years ago. Plants did the same in both this process and that of photosynthesis.</p>\n<p>Thus, we share biochemical similarities in varying degrees with other organisms and did ourselves evolve with a nutritional and medicinal dependency on other organisms &#8211; particularly plants.

Divaricata and L. Tridentata have been used medicinally for thousands of years by North American natives for a wide variety of illnesses &#8211; and to good effect.</p>\n<p>Chaparral (also called Creosote) may be found as an ingredient in Hoxsey-style formulas, including Black Salve.</p>\n<p>It is said to contain toxins. NDGA (Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid &#8211; a Lignan which is also called Masoprocol) is a very potent Detoxifier, a cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor and has potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticarcinomic and other actions. This may possibly mitigate some of the plant&#8217;s alleged toxicity, but I would strongly recommend keeping dosages very small. The lignans in Chaparral had IC50 values against several cancer cell lines of 5-60 micromole with the linear butane-type lignans being the most potent, and it was found that colon cancer cells were the least sensitive cell type tested. The relative potency of linear butane type lignans against human breast cancer appears to correlate positively with the number of O-methyl groups present on the molecule. Immunomodulatory proteins in Chaparral elicit immune response in mammals. The antibodies thus generated by the Immune System are active against bacteria. A resinous coating covers the leaves and stems of the Chaparral plant, which makes it sticky business to collect. This wax-like coating consists mainly of flavonoids, approximately 50%, along with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) in approximately the same 50% ratio. Flavonoids have been found to be beneficial to the walls of capillaries throughout the body, and so are good to take regularly in cases of capillary fragility. The main ingredient though, (as far as what is seen as the most active constituent in the plant), is NDGA. It is responsible for inhibiting several enzyme reactions, including lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, which are responsible for some unhealthy inflammatory and immune-system responses. It has been shown to reduce inflammatory histamine responses in the lung, which is good news for asthma sufferers. NDGA is one of the most highly anti-oxidant substances known to man. Several types of tumours, such as those in uterine fibroids and fibrosystic breast disease, may be helped immensely by a concentrated extract form of the plant if toxic effects can be mitgated. Recent new studies have shown that Chaparral can improve liver function, causing the liver metabolism to increase, clearing toxins, and improving the livers&#8217; ability to synthesize fatty acids into high density lipids (HDLs) while the low density lipid levels (LDLs) decrease. For people who have a history of heavy drinking, hepatitis, or exposure to toxic chemicals (all of which damage liver tissue), a combination of Chaparral with milk thistle seed standardized extract and Tribulus Terrestris (common puncture vine) may help recover the normal function of the liver to a large degree . The strong antioxidant effects of Larrea Tridentata appear to repair free radical damage caused by drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. Indigenous peoples of the Southwestern area of North America used Chaparral for treating such ailments as: tuberculosis, bowel complaints, cancers, colds and flu. In the Southwestern eclectic tradition, (a marriage of various Native American traditions with Spanish herbal traditions), Chaparral is used to heal stomach ulcers and bowel disorders, as well as for the anti-fungal topical uses listed below. External uses of the herb include poultices placed on aching joints, and the tea or a fermentation (applied several times per day and left on the area) for such things as ringworm, skin fungi, and athlete&#8217;s foot. For this type of problem, Chaparral can be combined with Thuja or Tea tree essential oils. A foot soak for nail fungus can be used by placing 2 large handfuls of the dried herb into a vessel which is large enough to comfortably accommodate both feet at once. Heat water to boiling, and pour onto herb until it is covered (2 to 3 inches deep), and let the herb steep for awhile, until the water is cool enough to put your feet into, while still being pretty hot. Leave the raw herb floating in the water, and soak your feet in the tea while you read a book or watch a movie, leaving them in the tea until it is cool, (and your feet look &#8220;prune-like&#8221;.) During this process, the anti-fungal liquid (tea) is absorbed into the tissues of the feet, where it can inhibit fungal growth and kill existing infestations. An essential oil of Lavender, Tea tree, or Thuja. As with many herbs having strong properties (like Larrea), some caution is advised. There is a therapeutic window of use, which means more is NOT always better. The fact that this herb can so strongly affect the liver, (increasing function&#8230;and heating) may be good to a point, but taking too much may stimulate the liver too strongly, and cause liver damage&#8230;&#8230;Of course, taking too many Aspirin can do this too&#8230; So just be careful when using this herb.. not to exceed the amount recommended, and to observe your own body carefully, and heed what it &#8220;tells&#8221; you.</p>\n<p>For many years, reports citing the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of herbal products (especially if taken as concentrated pill or tablet forms) containing creosote bush have aroused concern, both in the public, as well as in the scientific community (Mc Cann, 2003; Skidmore-Roth, 2003; Mahady et al., 2001). However, few of the 18 reports of liver damage in people employing creosote bush were related to the use of the plant as an infusion (tea), which is the traditional method of application (Castleman, 2001). In a clinical trial, 10% extracts made from this plant did not present toxicity when taken internally, even during prolonged periods of time (Heron and Yarnell, 2001). </p>\n<p>Uses of Larrea:<br />\n\u2022 To dissolve urinary calculi (kidney stones). (Adame and Adame, 2000; V\u00e1zquez, 1999; Dimayuga, 1996; Mart\u00ednez, 1989; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998).<br />\n\u2022 As an anti inflammatory to treat respiratory ailments (asthma) and arthritis (Foster and Tyler, 2000; Karch, 1999; Melgarejo and Cupp, 2000).<br />\n\u2022 To eliminate gallstones (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Dimayuga, 1996).<br />\n\u2022 Against urinary infections (Melgarejo and Cupp, 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Mart\u00ednez, 1989).<br />\n\u2022 For the treatment of venereal disease (Dimayuga 1996; Barnes et al., 2002).<br />\n\u2022 As an abortifacient (Dimayuga, 1996).<br />\n\u2022 Against diabetes (Skidmore-Roth 2003; Luo et al,. 1998).<br />\n\u2022 Bronchitis and colds (Skidmore-Roth, 2003).<br />\n\u2022 Rheumatism (Vazquez, 1999; Barnes et al,. 2002).<br />\n\u2022 Against some types of cancer (Skidmore-Roth 2003; Melgarejo and Cupp, 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Barnes et al., 2002).<br />\n\u2022 Inhalation of the resin vapors is employed against dizziness (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998).<br />\n\u2022 As a mouthwash against tooth decay and halitosis (bad breath) (McCann, 2003; Castleman, 2001).<br />\n\u2022 Externally for skin infections, especially those caused by bacteria and fungi (Castleman, 2001; Adame and Adame, 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Mart\u00ednez, 1989).<br />\n\u2022 As a foot bath against odor (Adame and Adame, 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998).<br />\n\u2022 The resinous substances present in both L. tridentata and L. diarivcata act as strong antioxidants especially in fats, oils and other substances, which is why this species is of interest as a possible antitumour agent.<br />\n\u2022 Some of the substances contained in creosote bush, especially Nor-DihydroGuaiaretic Acid (NDGA) inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme. Since this enzyme is implicated in the oxidative conversion of procarcinogens to carcinogens, the inhibition of cyclooxygenase could be a factor to prevent cancer, although the preliminary results are mixed and further research is needed in this area of study (Gonzales and Bowden, 2002; Castleman, 2001; McDonald et al., 2001; Foster and<br />\nTyler, 2000; Melgarejo and Cupp, 2000; Anesini et al., 2001, 1999, 1996; Diaz Barriga et al., 1999; Miller and Murray, 1999).<br />\n\u2022 In one study, the proposed anticancer activity of creosote bush\u2019s active ingredients seems to be present in vitro, but not in vivo (Hoferova et al., 2003).<br />\n\u2022 It has been found that NDGA belongs to a novel family of microtubule-stabilizing compounds that protect microtubules in NRK cells from depolymerization caused by various drugs such as colchicine, ilimaquinone, nocodazole and vinblastine (Nakamura et al., 2003).<br />\n\u2022 Mexican folk medicine uses this herb as a weak infusion (tea) in order to reduce the size of kidney and gall bladder stones (V\u00e1zquez, 1999; Argueta, 1994; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Adame and Adame, 2000; Mart\u00ednez, 1989). It should be noted, however, that Mexican herbalists recommend that if the plant is to be taken internally, infusions (teas) made from the leaves should be very weak, not concentrated and that treatment be limited from only a few days to a maximum of two weeks (Adame and Adame, 2000).<br />\n\u2022 Studies in hamsters have suggested that the main active principle in this plant, NDGA may be responsible for its action against the formation of gall bladder stones. The animals receiving creosote bush leaves in their diet did not show any signs of cholelitiasis, but, on the other hand, did manifest signs of serious toxicity (Granados and Cardenas, 1994).<br />\n\u2022 NDGA and other lignans contained in Larrea tridentata have been found to have microbicidal properties against a variety of bacteria, including: Penicillium, Salmonella, Streptococcus species, as well as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (Barnes et al., 2002; Verastegui et al., 1996; Anesini and Perez, 1993).</p>\n<p>The common name Chaparral is also used for the unrelated Species, Pickeringia Montana or Chaparral Pea, a member of the pea/bean family Fabaceae. It shares the same desert habitat of Larrea.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5934\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5934\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5934\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 5:56 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5934#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5934\", \"5934\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Where &#8220;toxicity&#8221; of Larrea is concerned, it may well be that the toxin mobilising effects of NDGA are the real cause. It extracts embedded toxins from the tissues and thus puts them into circulation in the blood and lymph, such that the Liver must then process them via glucuronidation to facilitate removal from the system. This is why it qualifies as a detox agent. Because the detox process at a systemic level is still dependent on the Liver with agents like NDGA, EDTA, DMPS or DMSA, dosages must be carefully paced to avoid excessive levels of these chelates. If safe dosages are exceeded, symptoms of toxaemia can manifest &#8211; this is known as Herxheimer&#8217;s Syndrome. So it may well be that NDGA, which is a Lignan (oligosaccharide), is not toxic itself, but that it can generate a toxic condition if over-used.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5936\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5936\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5936\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 9:06 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5936#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5936\", \"5936\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Some of the most amazing things I have discovered and drawn fabulous inferences from do not relate directly to cancer medicine, although one stream of these does offer profound potential in medicine. These are in the realm of recent cutting edge research by scientists at the very fringe of currently accepted science &#8211; or even beyond it.</p>\n<p>The central focus is on DNA.</p>\n<p>Now, DNA is a polymeric sugar-nucleotide complex &#8211; therefore a nucleoside. It is understood even by many laypeople that DNA has the will to survive, evolve and reproduce encoded into it.</p>\n<p>Early revelations I uncovered some seven to ten years ago when researching over-unity effects brought me to the conclusion that Gravity can be generated artificially by creating a zone-separated difference of electric charge density. One can follow up on this stuff by researching &#8220;Flux Capacitors&#8221; and comparing the phenomenon with the dynamics of any atom or Baryon. They are consistent and the possibility that the phenomenon might be caused by one of the four forces other than Gravity (Electric, Magnetic, Weak Nuclear or Strong Nuclear) was logically and easily eliminated.</p>\n<p>More recently, a reference to charge density came to my attention in literature about DNA and an anticancer agent called Poly-MVA. I followed it up in ever-increasing depth and found several examples of scientific research that provide considerable corroboration without much conflicting data at all; so inevitably, a cascade of realisations occurred in lieu of all this.</p>\n<p>Yes, apparently, DNA can acquire and hold a zone-separated differential of electric charge density. This suggested that DNA should in theory be consequently capable of generating Gravity independently of the natural tendency of its individual atoms and baryons to do so. That was the hypothesis. Would it be static gravitational force, or could emission and/or absorption of gravitational waves also manifest? Was there scientific corroboration to be found for either or both phenomena?</p>\n<p>Oh yes &#8211; definitely.</p>\n<p>One of the noteworthy experiments was that in which human corpses were precisely weighed shortly after death and continued to be weighed at intervals over a longer period of time beyond death. It was shown that the weight of these corpses changed independently of their actual mass. The researchers reported something to the effect that, &#8220;&#8230;The human spirit has been weighed.&#8221; I formed the hypothesis that this may not have been the &#8220;spirit leaving the body&#8221; as such, but the effect of DNA losing electric charge (leakage without recharge) over time following death. That, according to my reasoning, would result in loss of static gravitational force being generated by the DNA.</p>\n<p>Hardly conclusive, of course, but keep in mind the behaviour of flux capacitors which hundreds of hobbyists around the world seem to like playing with. Then couple that with what you often witness when you watch top-level basketball matches. You see players take flying leaps at the hoop and their trajectories through the air appear to defy the earth&#8217;s gravity to a degree &#8211; gravity should pull them down sooner than it actually does. Their trajectories are slightly longer and slightly flatter than they should be for the velocity at which they travel &#8211; for just a very short moment in time. I have done the very same thing, myself on a couple of occasions only, but never so consistently as elite athletes regularly do and not to such an easily observable degree as they do, either. Always in these cases, overdoses of adrenaline are involved. Nervous system activity is dramatically intensified. And something else happens, too. Their perception of the lapsing of time changes, too. These moments in flight seem to happen in slow motion to those who are performing the feat. High jumpers and pole vaulters also use it, together with a finely trained physical discipline of moving one part of the body through a height above the centre of mass with exquisite timing, so that they can clear the bar without the centre of mass attaining the required height for them to do so. But this discipline cannot alter the trajectory of the centre of mass. It&#8217;s the former phenomenon which does that.</p>\n<p>OK, so if it&#8217;s a valid observation, there must be a mechanism that makes modification of a trajectory possible.</p>\n<p>Enter the next very interesting corroboration &#8211; a DNA experiment by Drs. Vladimir Poponin and Peter Gariaev, conducted simultaneously in Russia and the USA. They set up a vaccuum chamber in each location and put a laser beam through it. Predictably, the light was not influenced. Then they placed DNA in the chamber and repeated the laser application. This time, the beam was influenced and inherited a coherent interference pattern. That was also predictable. However, what they did next was to remove the DNA altogether and put the beam through the chamber again. One should expect that the interference pattern should not happen, but it did. Moreover, the laser&#8217;s interference pattern persisted for almost a month afterwards in each of several such tests conducted.</p>\n<p>What force caused the interference to persist like that?</p>\n<p>Only one force comes up trumps &#8211; the one that can alter the character and topography of Spacetime, itself &#8211; Gravity of the static kind. Time was locally dilated within the chamber, for if it were not so, the laser interference pattern should not have manifested at all when the DNA was removed. Therefore, in the converse, Space was locally compressed &#8211; a clear gravitational effect.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about Gravity waves? These are generated and propagated by alternating a static gravitational force.</p>\n<p>For a demonstration of that, one needs to look at The Intention Experiment per Dr. Lynne McTaggart. Static Gravity could not have done what occurred in that series of experiments, because cause and effect EVENTS were influenced at the quantum level. Only gravity waves can do that, by being intercepted and absorbed by remote matter-energy systems &#8211; but more significantly in this particular case, by minds and the resultant human behaviour. That means ENCODED GRAVITY WAVES. Could DNA have been responsible for manifesting gravity waves that were modulated by INTENTION in this manner? Are human minds influenced by gravity waves encoded with thought? And could it not only explain this, but the observations by quantum physicists that sub-elementary particles routinely pop into existence to be observed as a result of the INTENT to observe them? It is the intent that actually manifests them. Could this explain it?</p>\n<p>Look at the molecular structure of DNA. It&#8217;s a long chain polymer, double stranded, with thousands of crosslinks. Its atoms naturally oscillate. It&#8217;s an unavoidable consequence of electron activity and resulting recoils in the atoms and in fact, the electron transitions routinely emit wave energies, including some gravitational at the purely atomic or baryonic level. Electrons themselves are the dynamic oscillators &#8211; their transitions are what set the waves in motion, or capture incoming waves. The atoms vibrate physically as well as in EM and gravity spectra, because of the physical recoils due to conversion of energy. All of these are retransmitted in some way to other atoms and so on, first within the molecule and then beyond. SO DNA has inbuilt tendency to oscillate. Then if you perceive the two long sugar polymers and the crosslinks, you can see a means of resonating (tuning) the frequencies of those oscillations, because they are of fixed lengths through huge numbers of loops. So it&#8217;s like a complex tuned circuit, analogous to what you find in a radio. If you have electronics expertise, then look again and see the powerful analogy with a Phase Locked Loop, because DNA does indeed offer physical characteristics that qualify it very well in this regard &#8211; Nature&#8217;s own Phase Locked Loop. Here are your carrier frequencies and there could be millions of them, determined by selective separation of the strands and certain select crosslinks &#8211; thus changing the combinations of resonances.</p>\n<p>Next, you might want to look at field intensification to strengthen the signal. That requires coiling of the &#8220;circuit&#8221;. Again, it&#8217;s easy. DNA is coiled up in three ways. Its primary coiling is the natural helical twist of the molecule. Its secondary coiling is around spherical protein complexes called Histones. Its tertiary coiling is the way it is wound up into more compact forms called Chromosomes. The signal fields I speak of are naturally intensified three ways all at once. The coils are coiled and the coiled coils are coiled, yet again.</p>\n<p>Modulating the signal outputs from this with brainwaves? Too easy. And Doctors Poponin and Gariaev noted emphatically in their conclusions regarding their &#8220;DNA Phantom Effect&#8221; experiments that the Holy Grail of Physics &#8211; the TOE or Theory Of Everything &#8211; cannot be replete without an integration of a sound Theory Of Consciousness. They clearly recognise that Consciousness manifests and is influenced by energy waves.</p>\n<p>So we have a logically plausible explanation for such phenomena as faith healing, telepathy, NLP and &#8220;The Law OF Attraction&#8221; per Tony Robbins &#8211; just about all of that mind power stuff. I&#8217;ve conducted experiments in this field, myself. Precognition experiments were only marginally successful, and psychokinesis experiments were something of a flop, but telepathy experiments with rigid controls were nothing less than astounding. And others have conducted much more definitive experiments than I ever could.</p>\n<p>So, there is relevance at this level to healing and other interesting things.</p>\n<p>I have postulated the hypothesis that DNA sits at the very confluence of Biological Life and Consciousness &#8211; and in addition, that its energy wave manifestation does not obey the Euclidian laws of spacetime dimensionality as we normally use them to interpret our physical reality here on Earth.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s another beauty of a revelation. I suspect that many cutting edge astrophysicists and quantum physicists have also come to realise what I have regarding the very nature of the Spacetime Continuum, itself. It is not static like a &#8220;solid&#8221;, nor even semi-static with a certain &#8220;elasticity&#8221; like rubber. Were it so, the coherent interference pattern of the laser beam in each &#8220;DNA Removed&#8221; test would have decayed almost instantly.</p>\n<p>Yet the DNA Phantom Effect persisted for almost a month in each test. </p>\n<p>Look again at the DNA Phantom Effect. Were the vaccuum chambers in America and Russia static? Nope. In Moscow, the vacuum chamber was moving with the Earth&#8217;s rotation at about 895 kmh. In the space of almost a month, there was a distance travelled in circles of 300,000 Km. But the Earth travels around Sol at an even greater speed &#8211; about 9400 kmh for a distance of about 76,000,000 Km. Ah, but Sol travels around the galaxy at an even greater velocity and the galaxy is travelling somewhere through space at some nominal fraction of the speed of light. If the Continuum were more or less static, then that tiny portion of it within the vacuum chamber would have moved beyond the chamber in a tiny fraction of a second. The chamber could have physically captivated and carried it, because we&#8217;re talking about the very medium in which matter exists &#8211; what we perceive as &#8220;empty space&#8221;. So there could not possibly be a persistent residual influence upon Spacetime within the chamber &#8211; UNLESS&#8230;</p>\n<p>Unless Spacetime were a FLUID, such that the local portion of it within the chamber just happened to be travelling along with the Earth&#8217;s motion.</p>\n<p>So Spacetime followed the earth&#8217;s motion. Ergo &#8211; FLUID medium, much like the earth&#8217;s atmosphere, if you want to visualise an analogous substitute model that adequately fits the picture. This then throws up all the possible equivalent effects one observes in Fluid Dynamics &#8211; expansion, contraction, density fluctuations, boundary layers, adhesion, Bernoulli Effect, Tolmien-Schlichting Waves, Eddy currents, vortices, direct interaction with matter, flow regimes, flow curvature, shearing effects and so on.</p>\n<p>Bloody magnificent.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5937\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5937\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5937\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 9:20 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5937#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5937\", \"5937\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Typo erratum: &#8220;&#8230;the chamber could NOT have physically captivated and carried it&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5938\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5938\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5938\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 10:18 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5938#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5938\", \"5938\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>IRT \u2013 INTEGRATIVE REGULATORY THERAPY \u2013 Oasis Of Hope Contreras Hospital</p>\n<p>Foreword:</p>\n<p>During February of 2010, I finally got around to doing what I&#8217;d intended to do with regard to contacting a Mexican hospital that specialises in cancer treatment. I wrote of that intention somewhere in Cancer&#8217;s Answers previously. The intention was to try to obtain information on the available types of treatment and anything they may have in the way of statistics concerning treatment results with their patients. I hoped to be able to compare these with stats from mainstream oncology and was pretty sure that if I actually did get any such stats, they would certainly show better results than mainstream American oncology does. I chose Contreras simply because it was the most widely known and probably the most reputable among the numerous Mexican hospitals (mainly located in Tijuana) that ply the &#8220;American cancer tourist trade&#8221;. Actually in all honesty, I did not entertain any great expectations of even getting a reply.</p>\n<p>However, on the 6th of March, I found a package in my mailbox from Contreras Hospital \u2013 it appeared to contain a book. I took it indoors, opened the envelope and inspected the contents. Yes, it was indeed a book. Nothing else \u2013 no letter or anything \u2013 just the book titled, &#8220;HOPE \u2013 Medicine &amp; Healing&#8221; by Francisco Contreras, MD &amp; Daniel F. Kennedy, MC (Second Edition, \uf0e3 2009). The sender&#8217;s address was interesting, however, because the package was sent from San Diego, California. It appears that Contreras has opened an Oasis Of Hope centre on the northern side of the Mexican border, circa 2006.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, this is more than I really expected,&#8221; I thought of actually having received a book, of all things, &#8220;But it just might prove to be a lot more!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I settled down to read it without further ado and finished reading it with the dual conclusions that it certainly was a great deal more than I expected and that I would have to write up on it in this Chapter. Indeed, this may well be the most important such article that is ever likely to appear in this Chapter. Such was the quality of what I learned about Contreras Hospital.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t help observing (and not without enjoying the bonus for my ego) the remarkable similarity between Contreras Hospital&#8217;s Integrated Regulatory Therapy and my own &#8220;Holistically Integrated Cancer Strategy&#8221;. They have some smallish differences, but so much in common! Begin with the fact that both are specifically designed from the ground up as comprehensive, fully integrated cancer treatment regimes intended to tackle every possible aspect of cancer and most importantly, the patient as a whole person \u2013 not merely the disease. There are comparatively few fully integrated holistic cancer treatment systems in existence at all, even on paper such as mine \u2013 far less those like IRT that are actually in full practice. This is more sophisticated than what I previously believed Contreras Hospital to have been doing. Other integrative therapies are listed with overviews in the next subdivision of this Chapter (06G2)</p>\n<p>According to my perceptions, both IRT and HICS have been evidenced by the contents of this book from Contreras to exhibit certain shortcomings. Nothing major \u2013 it&#8217;s just that both could be improved, each by the design of the other. Well, I wasted no time improving those of my own HICS, guided by what I learned from the book. What now remains is the converse, whereby the aspects of HICS which are not currently shared by IRT and which stand to improve it, may be integrated into IRT at some time in the future. Obviously, that is not something I can do \u2013 it is up to Dr. Contreras and his medical staff. However, it is at least possible for me to present suggestions I feel are appropriate to Oasis Of Hope and this I did during late April, 2010.</p>\n<p>HICS now provides for the use of Ozone Therapy in the form of O3-AHT as a preconditioning regimen designed to protect a patient from ill effects of chemotherapy (if used), or indeed any cohort of anticarcinomic agents that might otherwise subject the patient to potential harm resulting from their use and especially from systemic oxidative stress. Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy is an equivalent \u2013 pretty much the same thing, to all intents and purposes. Although I still feel chemotherapy is unnecessary in view of the very existence of Acetogenins, that accommodation even extends to more readily embracing the idea of using chemotherapy agents if there is a clear benefit to be had, provided that it satisfactorily adheres to Fundamental Principles in cancer treatment I set down in Chapter Two. Under Contreras design, those fundamentals are adhered to, because Contreras practices under the very same principles. It also recognizes greater value in selective high-dosage of Vitamins A, C, D &amp; K3. Also on the Philosophical side of things, Contreras opened my mind to embrace a redefined concept of success in cancer treatment and the doctor, hospital, patient and support network relationship. Those were two more good things.</p>\n<p>The improvements that IRT stands to gain from the HICS model mainly hinge on using Acetogenins as the principal means of combating resistant cancers, supported with a few other agents, such as Piperine, Cantron, Alsihum and even THC. Acetogenins in particular represent a more decisively effective solution to the problem of resistant cancers than Contreras&#8217;s existing approach. IRT could conceivably give stronger emphasis to Detoxification with the likes of Hispidulin, Clinoptilolite and/or EDTA (alternated with mineral supplements!) and might also do well to look at some additional cell differentiatimg agents \u2013 particularly Burzynski\u2019s Antineoplastons.</p>\n<p>Inclusion of Meditation into the Emotional and Spiritual Support elements of IRT, together with a non-religious spin option designed for atheistic or agnostic patients who don&#8217;t wish to embrace institutional religious beliefs to find inner strength, will also improve it. There are productive alternatives that are just as beneficial to atheists and agnostics as faith in God and Jesus is to Christians. After all, one does not wisely attempt to change a person&#8217;s belief system, but instead tries to harness that person&#8217;s existing belief for the better. I&#8217;m confident the people at Contreras already fully appreciate this, but I suspect they might not yet have such a design tailored for atheists and agnostics.</p>\n<p>IRT might also benefit by expanding the Preconditioning Element&#8217;s scope to embrace amelioration and rescue techniques in cases where people have already suffered harm from improper use of orthodox chemotherapy agents before presenting themselves to receive IRT. Actually, it&#8217;s at least possible that they already facilitate these measures, since they&#8217;d have been treating &#8220;terminal&#8221; chemotherapy victims from across the border in America for decades, but I\u2019ve got a beauty they could add to their rescue list \u2013 Hispidulin \u2013 and for that matter, Clinoptilolite is also superlative in this role.</p>\n<p>On the Theory side of things, IRT doesn&#8217;t overtly embrace microbial infection as a distinct facet of cancer causality or treatment, but it does fully include measures that are quite satisfactorily adequate to that purpose. Also in theory, it does not appear to embrace an idea that resistant cancers are characterised specifically by MDRCs, or more especially, that Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) are the probable progenitors of MDRCs, thereby accounting for the very much greater aggressiveness of resistant cancers.</p>\n<p>And although there are strong emotional and spiritual support elements in IRT, it is unclear whether IRT includes Meditation and the teaching of it, plus hypnotherapy perhaps, in its emotional and spiritual components. There is mention of &#8220;Psychoneuroimmunology&#8221; and &#8220;Psychoneuroimaging&#8221;, which are not unique to Contreras and which do appear to be in the Meditation-style stream.</p>\n<p>Electromedicine in the forms of Infrared, Rife, Lakhovsky or GEIPE Machines is not used by Oasis, either.</p>\n<p>For Oasis Of Hope, it is understood that there are legal considerations where the possible integration of certain treatments into IRT is concerned. Inclusion of Acetogenins should not be a problem, for although not approved in the U.S. by the FDA for specific medical treatment of cancer, that prohibition can be circumvented easily enough by legitimately calling them Dietary Supplements. Rife Machines and other electronic means of treating cancer (or other diseases) are another matter. It is unlikely that Oasis would be able to circumlocute existing prohibitions against these machines, so they are probably not a viable option. </p>\n<p>As a consequence of reading and learning from the book, I resolved to make a future attempt to open some dialogue with Dr. Francisco Contreras, who is incidentally the son of Contreras Hospital&#8217;s founder, Dr. Ernesto Contreras. To that end, I wrote to Dr. Contreras via email, but to my disappointment, I did not receive a reply. Still, with Contreras now in California, to say nothing of several other integrative medicine clinics operating across the USA, the cat is now among the pigeons. Whole mainstream cancer research and treatment institutions throughout America must now lift their disgraceful game \u2013 they&#8217;ve got serious competition they can no longer afford to ignore, if only for the sake of their own declining prestige and public image. It even appears that two of the worst such institutions have already begun to respond in a positive way to the Integrative Medicine influence by at least embracing Complementary Medicine. They are NCI and MSK and whilst they still fall short of the Integrative Medicine standard, at least there are signs of improvement. I am almost beside myself with unholy glee from having learned of this and I want to see how it further develops over the next several years.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5939\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5939\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5939\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 10:25 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5939#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5939\", \"5939\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>About Oasis Of Hope Contreras Hospital And IRT, From The Book,  &#8220;HOPE \u2013 Medicine &amp; Healing&#8221;:</p>\n<p>One could take this book I received from Contreras as a sort of handbook about Oasis Of Hope and IRT (Integrative Regulatory Therapy). I&#8217;ll cover it chapter by chapter, but will also note here that throughout the book, testimonials appear from fifteen Oasis Of Hope Patients. I have not reproduced these here.</p>\n<p>1. Your Healing Partner For Life.<br />\nDoctor Francisco Contreras here describes assemblage of a support team of &#8220;specialists&#8221; around a Team Captain, who is none other than the patient.  Francisco wrote, &#8220;To be invited into a person&#8217;s inner circle of confidence in spite of physical, emotional and spiritual vulnerability, is something I take very seriously. I believe that the patient-doctor relationship is sacred. I love the human spirit and I am inspired by the Holy Spirit to be a part of a patient&#8217;s support system. I am not afraid to hope for each one of my patients. It is my privilege to hope for those who cannot find the strength to hope for themselves. My resolve comes from the experience and profound example of the Oasis Of Hope founder, my father, Dr. Ernesto Contreras, Sr..&#8221;<br />\nErnesto Contreras set an example to his son, working with patients who considered a cure to be the only acceptable outcome to help them realize that the number of days one lives is less important than how one lives each day. From being able to see only the light at the end of the tunnel, they came also to see the path along the way and the opportunities it offers to live, as distinct from merely surviving. In subtle ways, it helps patients with the realization that mortality is biologically inevitable, whether it be tomorrow, or a hundred years into the future. Therefore, what truly matters in concert with extending one&#8217;s longevity where possible, is what one does with one&#8217;s tenure as a biological entity. Based upon the faith of Roman Catholicism, the people of Contreras Hospital also believe very firmly in what lies beyond death&#8217;s door and overall, they do try to help patients to embrace a more enlightened perspective \u2013 a greater vision. And from this perspective emerges the principle that total health means being well in mind, body and spirit.<br />\nWhen a person is diagnosed with cancer, the tendency is to become socially withdrawn. It&#8217;s a counterproductive and antiquated response, rather like what dinosaurs did when they got sick, by waltzing off to the tar pits. The right thing to do is the exact opposite.<br />\nOasis Of Hope has assembled a phenomenal team of specialists \u2013 expert physicians, surgeons, radiologists, nurses having decades of experience with cancer patients and researchers working on new therapies. Nutritionists, physiotherapists, counselors, educators teaching patients how to make lifestyle changes and even prayer partners are on the team. These spheres of expertise are brought together in an environment that strategically intervenes in a patient&#8217;s life as the very Oasis that the desert wanderer needs. It isn&#8217;t an ordinary hospital and the support provided there is available to patients as needed for life.</p>\n<p>2. Oasis Of Hope<br />\n&#8220;Wrap-around care&#8221; provides amongst other things for the relief of anxiety that people usually feel when they have a sense of being lost and so there is a focus on inspiring confidence and trust.<br />\nDr. Francisco Contreras recounts the story of a workaholic father who finally got around to keeping a promise to his son by taking him fishing for a day. The father had big expectations of making the day special for his son, but was greatly disappointed. He wrote in his diary, &#8220;Rained like crazy, caught nothing, worst day ever.&#8221; Several days later, he happened to see a picture that his son had drawn at school. It showed the two of them fishing in the rain. Below the drawing was written, &#8220;Dad and I went fishing. It rained all day and we didn&#8217;t catch anything. Best day of my life.&#8221;<br />\nPerspective. Every experience is unique to the individual and people experience illness differently, too. It&#8217;s why the &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach to treating disease is such a huge failure. On this premise, Oasis Of Hope tailors a treatment program for each individual patient by establishing a close personal connection to the patient, with personal understanding being an important element.<br />\nIt includes working to eliminate stress factors, which are factually known to weaken the immune system; contribute to cancer causality; and impede recovery.<br />\nIt emphasises care for the whole patient \u2013 not just the disease.<br />\nA significant aspect is learning to &#8220;live in the now&#8221;. And I know from personal experience that you are never more alive than when you&#8217;re living in the moment. It is where I love most to be, though I admit it is something that comes more easily to people like myself, who in the psychology science of Jung-Myers-Briggs Personality Typology are known as &#8220;Sensing Perceivers&#8221; or &#8220;Experiencers&#8221;. Such people represent about 27% of the population in a developed country. For other people of different dispositions, learning how to do that is a very worthwhile exercise in the whole context of life. It is not just so in cancer therapy alone.<br />\nDr. Contreras strongly believes in the importance of a firm grounding in Christ. That is of course a Christian outlook, so let&#8217;s make allowance for that and translate it to mean &#8220;a firm spiritual grounding&#8221;, preferably one that embodies the philosophical teachings of Christ or perhaps Buddha, remembering the already mentioned individual perspective thing. I personally agree quite strongly, given that I am not an institutional Christian and I don&#8217;t personify God or deify Jesus any more than I deify myself, or you, or anyone else. My personal concept of spirituality differs somewhat from a conventional Christian one. But I know a thing or three about DNA and the &#8220;Divine Matrix&#8221;, so I know factually that each of us is truly much more than a mere biological entity.<br />\nTherefore, focusing on spirituality in the context of a person&#8217;s individual belief system is a valid and tremendously important principle in cancer therapy.</p>\n<p>3. IRT \u2013 Integrative Regulatory Therapy</p>\n<p>&#8220;The final outcome of a system should be greater than the sum of its parts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>IRT comprises eight parts, or elements. They are:<br />\nOxidative Preconditioning<br />\nCytotoxic Therapy<br />\nCell Signal Transduction Therapy<br />\nRedox Regulatory Therapy<br />\nImmune Stimulation<br />\nDiet &amp; Exercise<br />\nEmotional Support<br />\nSpiritual Support</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5940\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5940\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5940\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 10:43 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5940#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5940\", \"5940\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Prior to my studying this book, the only significant elements lacking in my own HICS when compared with IRT was the Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy and the Emotional and Spiritual Support components, although HICS does feature incitements for emotional and spiritual conditioning and includes a meditation module. The closest equivalent HICS had previously to Oxidative Preconditioning was Potentiation Of Cytotoxins using agents such as DMSO or Insulin to target the cytotoxic agents more specifically to malignancies instead of healthy tissues and thereby similarly protect the patient from bad side effects. Well, I liked the idea of preconditioning and Oasis Of Hope also has an admirable working emotional and spiritual support infrastructure operating. These things made perfect sense, so accordingly, I improved the design of HICS \u2013 with the credit duly merited to Oasis Of Hope.<br />\nAh, but I have something I fully intend to offer in return!<br />\nDr. Contreras swings onto that very issue here \u2013 in fact it&#8217;s the most critical failure of orthodox oncology and he does broach it very early in this chapter. He uses the rapid evolution of technology to illustrate a point, making analogy of the fact that change happens so fast now that the latest new gadget is already out of date by the time it hits retail shop shelves. In a similar way, cancer cells exhibit an ability to rapidly evolve through mutation and so become resistant to the latest chemotherapy or radiation treatment, which is thereby effectively rendered out of date.<br />\nHe describes the last four decades as ones in which researchers have made monumental efforts to examine and understand cancer. They&#8217;ve worked hard to learn all they can about the causes of cancer, nature of cancer and the principles that govern the growth and spread of cancer. To this end, they&#8217;ve examined tumours and individual cells in every known type of cancer. In laboratories and the halls of medicine, they have attacked cancer with every imaginable tool and substance. They have used hundreds of advanced surgical procedures, a variety of methods to burn malignancies and an arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents to destroy cancer in the most hidden niches of the body. In over 35 years, the medical community has spent hundreds of billions of dollars researching new cancer treatments, but failed to significantly impact the incidence of cancer, or the cancer mortality rate.<br />\nDoctor Contreras asks, &#8220;Why is it that the world&#8217;s greatest minds, blessed with virtually unlimited funding have struggled to make even the humblest dent in the cancer epidemic?&#8221;<br />\nA rhetorical question, for almost every oncologist knows the principal reason and Dr. Contreras answers the question by saying, &#8220;One significant factor is that cancers can mutate and become resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. This is especially true, once cancer spreads.&#8221;<br />\nHe further explains that a patient&#8217;s chances of survival are much higher when the cancer is caught early and the tumour is still localised, because it can be totally removed. I would qualify that by adding, &#8220;In most cases.&#8221;<br />\nYet by Stage IV, the cancer has spread or metastasised to other organs. Things get complicated and the treatment options can become exceedingly dangerous. Unfortunately, many patients don&#8217;t discover they have cancer until it has already reached Stage IV. That is because early-stage cancers don&#8217;t present a host of obvious symptoms and are not easily detected. I add, &#8220;Except in people who regularly undergo thorough checkups with adequate frequency&#8221;.<br />\nSo too many people become completely devastated when an oncologist tells them it&#8217;s already too late. Now, sometimes these people refuse to accept that and begin their own search for a solution. It usually leads them to discovering alternative therapies of one kind or another.<br />\nDr. Contreras at this point explains the differences between Orthodox and Alternative cancer therapies. One important thing he notes here is that in Orthodox medicine, the focus is on the disease. In Alternative medicine, the focus is on the patient. The goal of orthodox cancer therapy is tumour eradication. He says that each of the three means of intervention \u2013 surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be extremely effective when used properly. The same can be said of some new types of intervention not mentioned by Dr. Contreras that are evolving in the orthodox medical stream, such as genetic engineering and HIFU.<br />\nBut he also remarks that an ethical oncologist recognises the many shortcomings and failings of conventional therapy. Most people are aware of the negative side effects of these three methods of treatment. Chemotherapies in particular are immunodepressant and kill healthy cells as well as malignant ones. It can take a terrible toll on the patient&#8217;s quality of life and in some cases, can actually shorten the patient&#8217;s life. Dr. Contreras does not comment quite so openly on the rarity of this ethic in oncology as I do, but he hints at it in a subtle way. He knows as I do that they typically forge ahead with such therapies, even knowing in advance that they are doomed to failure; and further that the side effects practically incapacitate the patient, who is then left without any decent quality of life for whatever survival time remains.<br />\nSo, he amplifies on this disadvantage that is even more significant than the side effects and lost quality of life. The cancer cells become resistant to therapy over time. So patients who respond well to therapy at first will find that they no longer respond so well on subsequent treatment cycles.<br />\nImmunosppression by chemotherapy is the second major reason why. These two major problems are the reasons why thousands of people seek alternatives. Considering that about 65% of people with Stage IV breast cancers will survive more than one year and less than 20% will survive longer than five years, it is understandable that so many people want to see if there is another more promising approach. And although I should add here that orthodox researchers are now working harder to develop targeted treatments aimed at resistant cancers that do not cause massive collateral damage, or suppress the Immune System and blood forming organs, they still have a very long way to go.<br />\nThe term &#8220;Alternative&#8221; can mean just about anything under the sun, from Vegan diets or juice regimens to reflexology and magnet therapy. The main belief in alternative medicine is that a person&#8217;s Immune System must be boosted to a healthy balance (which is not so in orthodox cancer medicine). Then, the body will heal itself of any illness from heart disease to diabetes to cancer. Juicing, vitamin and mineral supplements, detox and Immune System building all have great merit.<br />\n&#8220;God designed the human body with great abilities to heal itself and even has immune system cells that are specifically tasked with killing mutated cells.<br />\nBut alternative medicine has many deficiencies, as well, says Dr. Contreras. In my mind, that may depend on precisely what is meant by alternative medicine. But his comments are perfectly valid, as the following shows.<br />\nJust as there are oncologists who know nothing about nutrition (or Biodynamic Balance either, if I may add\u2026), there are many alternative medicine clinics that don&#8217;t have oncologists on staff \u2013 that is to say, there is no one formally trained in mainstream cancer treatment. There is often also a great lack of clinical trials to support using many alternative medicine treatments.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Contreras here, the biggest shortcoming of alternative treatments is that many cancers are just too aggressive to respond to purely natural medicines.<br />\nWell, this is the cornerstone of what I propose to contribute towards the improvement of Oasis Of Hope&#8217;s IRT, if Dr. Contreras and colleagues have not already adopted this critical element of HICS. That is because in fact, there ARE purely natural medicines that are not only more than powerful enough to deal decisively with most cancers including all the most aggressive ones, but which are also decisively effective against all resistant cancers. Moreover, some of them are not merely adequately powerful enough to compare with the strongest orthodox chemotherapy agents, but are actually a damned sight MORE powerful. Three in particular are, as I have already stated multiple times throughout Cancer&#8217;s Answers, the most potent known anticarcinomics on the whole planet, bar absolutely none. One is a BILLION times more potent than Adriamycin against at least one malignant cell line. The other two are a TRILLION times more potent, again being so with at least one malignant cell line. Few cancer cells have resistance to it and those cells cannot be of the aggressive kind, because Acetogenins stop ALL aggressive cancers cold. That&#8217;s still not all, because on top of all that, the side effect profile of these substances (Bullatacin, Asiminocin &amp; Trilobacin) and many other similar Acetogenins is miniscule compared with every one of the non-targeted chemotherapy drugs, plus many of the targeted ones and especially MABs. That is because it and other Acetogenins are so incredibly selective that they ARE targeted therapies in their own rights.<br />\nAnyway, back to IRT.<br />\nFor years, according to Dr. Contreras, oncologists have criticised alternative medicine doctors and accused many of being scam artists. Alternative doctors fought back, stating that the failure rates of chemotherapy are unacceptable and that the treatments make the patients suffer more than the disease. Of course, I strongly agree. I think they\u2019re life wreckers and butchers.<br />\nThe great news is an emerging trend called &#8220;Integrative Medicine&#8221;. This approach combines all the best therapies into one synergistic whole. Oasis Of Hope is one of the trendsetters, with more than 45 years of experience in integrative cancer treatment. It is followed by Cancer Treatment Centers Of America, with over 25 years and now, major centres such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering, MD Anderson and others are starting to enhance their therapies using complementary medicine.<br />\nDr. Contreras adds, &#8220;Hopefully, these major centers will graduate from Complementary Medicine up to the major league of Integrative Medicine! Oasis Of Hope continues to be in a class of its own, however, because our approach is not just about what treatments we use; it is more about the whole treatment experience that we provide our patients. It&#8217;s a beautiful blend of medical competence and caring, of art and science, of faith, hope and love.&#8221;<br />\nNo mention is made in this Oasis book of the achievements of Burzynski, Livingston-Wheeler and a few other fairly well-known institutions in terms of where they stand in the statistical performance stakes. I\u2019d like to make comparisons, if at all possible.<br />\n&#8220;Close to 90% of the patients that come to Oasis Of Hope arrive with late stage cancers. They feel hopeless because they have been told nothing can be done and they should get their affairs in order. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is always hope.&#8221;<br />\nDr. Contreras addresses the reader directly here, by saying, &#8220;If you find yourself in these circumstances, please allow me to speak directly to you for a moment. To begin with, you are not a statistic. You are a person living with cancer and there are some options available to you that you may not have heard about. Your natural strengths can help you respond to this threat. Please do not discount the possibility of a miracle in your life.<br />\n&#8220;The other thing I want you to know is the field of molecular biology has made a number of significant breakthroughs, helping scientists and doctors understand the nuts and bolts of malignant cells and their behaviour. In addition, the medical community has developed less aggressive chemotherapies and found effective ways to minimise side effects. For more than two decades, I was an outspoken opponent of chemotherapy, but that was only because the treatment made patients suffer and rarely prolonged their lives for a significant amount of time. Chemotherapy by itself is still of little value. However, chemotherapy that is used as one element in an integrative medicine regimen can be extremely effective.&#8221;<br />\nThere is a brief overview of the synergistic effect of integrating therapies in the way of IRT and then Dr. Contreras gets down to explaining each of the eight elements listed at the beginning of this chapter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5941\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5941\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5941\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 10:44 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5941#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5941\", \"5941\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy: The first component \u2013 when the cells of our bodies are exposed to large quantities of oxidants, a condition called Oxidative Stress occurs and often results in tremendous damage. The body produces a number of natural antioxidants to try and prevent it. Cytotoxic chemotherapy often creates hazardous levels of oxidative stress, not only in the cancer, but also in the healthy tissues. OPT is intended to boost the capacity of the body&#8217;s normal tissues to withstand the oxidative stress imposed by chemotherapy. Exposing cells to an acute and repeated mild oxidative stress increases the antioxidant defense system. In Ozone Autohaemotherapy, 200 ml of a patient&#8217;s blood is drawn and this is exposed to Ozone and UV light. This treated blood is reinfused into the patient. The reinfused blood contains oxidised compounds, which serve as a signal of oxidative stress to the body&#8217;s healthy tissues, reflexively causing them to increase their production of protective antioxidant enzymes. (I think Super-Oxide Dismutase might be one of these.) This therapy ensures that the tissues are in much better condition to withstand the oxidative stress imposed by subsequent chemotherapy. That makes the chemotherapy much more tolerable and simultaneously improves the effectiveness of the chemo.</p>\n<p>Cytotoxic Therapy: This is the second component, which is designed to destroy cancer cells. Coupled with Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy, the cancer killing effects are maximised, while the side effects are minimised.</p>\n<p>Cell Signal Transduction Therapy: This third component uses pharmacy grade vitamin &amp; mineral supplements and safe drugs to target cell signalling pathways in cancer cells. This is designed to make cancer cells easier to kill, while also suppressing their capacity to grow, metastasise and evoke the growth of new blood vessels that feed tumours. The term, &#8220;Signal Transduction&#8221; refers to the way in which cellular proteins undergo small and usually reversible changes in their structure, to induce alterations in cell behaviour. Genetic material in cancer cells is typically altered by mutation in ways that over-activate intracellular signalling pathways that promote unregulated growth and spread of malignancies; or that make them harder to kill by the immune system, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Cell Signal Transduction Therapy seeks to inhibit these overactive signaling pathways, making cancers easier to kill and control.</p>\n<p>Redox Regulatory Therapy: This fourth component selectively targets tumour sites with intense levels of oxidative stress. The therapy is designed to attack tumour cells only and present no harm to healthy tissue. The combination of high-dose Vitamin C therapy (I suspect in concert with Vitami K3), coupled with Ozone Autohaemotherapy and the oxygen carrier Perftec achieves this effect. It can hold tumour growth at bay while boosting the killing effect of concurrent cytotoxic therapy.</p>\n<p>Immune Stimulation Therapy: This fifth component is designed to aid the Immune System&#8217;s ability to attack cancer by optimising the function of Natural Killer Cells and Cytotoxic T-Cells. The therapy employs a two-pronged approach. The first involves using natural products that boost the function of the Immune System. The second involves the use of substances that block mechanisms the tumours use to suppress the Immune System.</p>\n<p>Diet &amp; Exercise: This sixth component is significant improvement with regard to diet and exercise. World evidence for the preventive and curative use of diets low in fats and animal proteins is compelling. In addition, the preventive and curative benefits of regular aerobic exercise is widely acknowledged. More recent research suggests these strategies may also help to slow the growth and spread of many pre-existing cancers. Prudent advice on diet and lifestyle is a key component of therapy at Oasis Of Hope. Personally I advocate some variations to the diet constituency, because fat consumption is not such a major issue, even of saturated ones. The Omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids are particularly important and so are all kinds of Cholesterols. You need them. What is desirable is to limit consumption of high GI (Glycaemic Index) carbohydrates such as Glucose, Sucrose, Wheat and Corn Starches; to maintain a healthy sensitivity to Insulin and avoid producing surplus of it (because this stuff stimulates lipid cells to convert carbohydrates into fats \u2013 and plenty of exercise is a major Insulin regulator); plus good levels of endogenous antioxidants that prevent Cholesterols from oxidising. If Cholesterols don\u2019t oxidise, they don\u2019t precipitate on blood vessel walls and you don\u2019t get arteriosclerosis. These things may not relate directly to cancer, but they DO relate directly to your general constitutional health and that in turn has an important influence in the malignancy equation.</p>\n<p>Emotional Support: The seventh component is the development of an emotional support structure, not only at the hospital but at home, as well. Cancer can tax the strongest individual. Energy is required to learn about the illness, embrace treatment and alter lifestyle. It creates a need for an external emotional support system to strengthen and refresh the patient. No doubt, this includes helping the patient come to terms with anger, sorrow, loneliness and any other emotional states that could affect their ability to combat the disease. I imagine quite easily that this would involve measures to improve the patient&#8217;s focus on positive things, such as the love of family and friends, as well as to help assemble the right people around the patient in the form of a support network and even to show them how best to provide that needed support. Overall, this component has a powerful impact on the program.</p>\n<p>Spiritual Support: The eighth component concerns development of spiritual security. There&#8217;s no question that fear and anxiety produced by the spectre of death and insecurity regarding the afterlife have a significant impact on a patient&#8217;s overall physical and emotional state. Oasis Of Hope seeks to provide avenues for patients to develop the hope, peace and security that stems from a healthy relationship with God. This, too, positively impacts a patient&#8217;s ability to engage in the whole process of disease management. As I remarked earlier, there is no mention of equivalent strategies for augmenting outlooks of atheist or agnostic people in a spiritual sense, although since Contreras has treated many people of non-Christian faiths with similar success, there is a suggestion that they must have something appropriate for such people in their IRT design. This segment of the chapter also speaks of the changeability of the cancer condition, such that treatments, which work quite well initially, may not do so well subsequently. Therefore, the whole must be confronted from every possible direction and strategies must be adaptable to the changing conditions. I might also add, though once again, it is not mentioned in the Contreras text, that people who are affected by closet skeletons such as feelings of guilt will have difficulty coming to terms with combating cancer at the best possible levels until they also come to terms with the skeletons. Here again, the spiritual support component of IRT can make a tremendous difference. For certain reasons of my own, I don&#8217;t separate the emotional and spiritual components of an integrated therapy. Contreras addresses the Emotional side separately from the Spiritual in the belief that the first comes from within, whilst the second comes from God. In my belief, it is more difficult to distinguish between such aspects in relation to emotion, spirituality, thought, faith, intent and the Divine. I believe instead that human consciousness at a certain level IS a slice of God \u2013 an individualised part of a tremendous collective consciousness. The stuff of miracles can be brought about by joining the &#8220;internal, individual&#8221; Subconscious and Conscious with the greater &#8220;external, collective&#8221; Superconscious, through using mental disciplines like Meditation, NLP, Manifesting and \u201cQuantum Jumping\u201d. By doing so, such as in Prayer, for example, one can &#8220;talk to the Universe (or God)&#8221; and derive great inspiration. In simple terms, I think of the Superconscious as the &#8220;Mind of the Universe&#8221; and the Universe and everything in it as the &#8220;Body of God.&#8221; However, which belief system is &#8220;factually correct&#8221; is unimportant. What truly matters is that any such set of beliefs can be harnessed equally well to achieve the same designs \u2013 mind over self, mind over body, mind over matter and even mind over reality. It is the very stuff of True Peace and of Miracles.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5942\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5942\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5942\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 10:49 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5942#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5942\", \"5942\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>4. People Get Ready</p>\n<p>This chapter goes into greater detail about the Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy. It indicates that direct infusion of Ozone into the body is a hazardous undertaking. But by infusing it into small amounts of extracted blood and allowing it to react to produce the oxides before it is reintroduced into the body, the hazards are eliminated and the oxides then do the job of signalling the body&#8217;s defensive mechanisms to produce the desired antioxidants. These will then serve to protect healthy tissues from oxidative damage by chemotherapy drugs in the following treatment phase called Cytotoxic Therapy. The procedure is repeated several times and has an excellent safety profile \u2013 virtually free of side effects. That is because the body&#8217;s tissues are not exposed to Ozone, but instead only to the oxides produced by the Ozone. These are in themselves harmless, but they signal oxidative stress, so the system reacts to them defensively as it would to the Ozone itself. But there is something more, as reported by Professor Richard A. Lerner MD, Associate Professor Paul Wentworth PhD and their research team in a 2002 article published in the prestigious journal, Science. The article was titled, &#8220;Evidence For Antibody-Catalyzed Ozone Formation in Bacterial Killing and Inflammation&#8221;. Ozone may be part of a previously unrecognised killing mechanism that enhances the defensive role of antibodies, by allowing them to subject pathogens to Hydrogen Peroxide. This may allow the antibodies to participate directly in the killing of pathogens.  The research opens up exciting possibilities for new antibody-mediated therapies for conditions ranging from bacterial and viral infection to cancer. If Ozone is indeed produced naturally by the human immune system, even skeptics have conceded this would give tremendous credibility to the concept of Ozone as a medical treatment. My own take on this is that the body probably does not produce Ozone within, except perhaps in the skin under exposure to UVB radiation. Instead, I perceive that Ozone introduced into the system will dissociate into O2 and O singlets. The singlets will either oxidize certain other substances in the system, or reassociate with H2O to form H2O2. In other words, it creates Hydrogen Peroxide. Furthermore, Hydrogen Peroxide IS in fact produced endogenously \u2013 for example, by Vitamin C in malignant tissues. It is for this reason that Hydrogen Peroxide is an equivalent therapy to Ozone. The philosophy behind Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy is, &#8220;Better prepared \u2013 better armed.&#8221; Here, I would like to add that such therapies, even by working against bacterial and viral infection alone, will have a definite effect against cancer.</p>\n<p>5. The Case For Chemotherapy</p>\n<p>This chapter expands upon the description of Cytotoxic Therapy. While speaking of a case for Chemotherapy when used as part of an integrated regimen that includes protective preconditioning, he first discusses the shortcomings and failures of chemotherapy when it is used exclusively. He notes that gene transcription errors in healthy tissue regeneration are normal and happen all the time. However, the body has inbuilt mechanisms to deal with this phenomenon, so there is usually no problem. There are genes that suppress mutation and the Immune System cleans up mutated cells. So it&#8217;s when these corrective mechanisms fail that cancerous cells develop. Then he moves on to mention that the earliest chemotherapy drugs were developed from the chemical warfare agent, Mustard Gas. Right from the outset, there was a problem with risk versus benefit. He then tells of 1971, when Richard Nixon teamed with NCI to declare war on cancer and instituted the National Cancer Act. In the following ten years, big strides were apparently made with some cancers. Successes were:<br />\nChoriocarcinoma, 90%<br />\nBurkitt&#8217;s Lymphoma (Stage I), 90%<br />\nTesticular Carcinoma (Stage II-III), 70-90%<br />\nChildhood Sarcomas (w/ radiation &amp; surgery), 70-90%<br />\nNodular Mixed Lymphoma, 75%<br />\nChildhood Lymphomas, 75%<br />\nDiffuse Histiocytic Lymphoma, 70%<br />\nAcute Lymphocytic Leukaemia, 60%<br />\nHodgkin&#8217;s Disease (Stage III &amp; IV), 60%<br />\nIn the cases of these particular cancers, Dr. Contreras indicates that he recommends the chemotherapy protocol that has yielded those results and no doubt improves upon them in the scheme of IRT. However, many of these cancers are quite rare and nothing significant was developed for many more common and more dangerous cancers. Also after that first decade, chemotherapy&#8217;s success seemed to stagnate. For the most common cancers (lung, breast, prostate, colon, stomach, pancreas, bladder, ovary, head, neck, etc.), which account for close to 90% of cancer deaths in the industrialised world; clinicians agree that chemotherapy is of little help.<br />\nThis was confirmed by biostatistician, Dr. Ulrich Abel of Heidelberg University.<br />\nAnd Dr. Albert Braverman, Professor of Haematology and Oncology at New York State University stated that no solid tumour, which was incurable in 1976 became curable by 1991.<br />\nPublishing in Lancet, he wrote, &#8220;The time has come to cut back on the clinical investigation of new chemotherapeutic regimens for cancer and to cast a critical eye on the way chemotherapeutic treatment is now being administered.&#8221;<br />\nJohn Bailar III is described as no ordinary scientist with an endless list of credentials and credits.<br />\nHe wrote, &#8220;\u2026cancer program is in big trouble&#8221; and &#8220;\u202635 years of intense effort focused on improving treatment must be judged as a qualified failure.&#8221;<br />\nIn the medical journals specialising in cancer, more than 1.5 million articles are about chemotherapy. Surprisingly, the bulk of the studies report success. They cite successes in petri dishes, guinea pigs and even patients in controlled clinical trials. Meanwhile, in cancer wards around the world, patients are dying at ever-increasing rates. Dr. Contreras says the news is not all bad. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the five-year survival rate for cancer patients improved from 50% in 1971 to 63% in 2003.<br />\nI say, &#8220;Big deal!&#8221;<br />\nAnd although Chemotherapy would have played a role, data is insufficient to credit chemotherapy alone for that improvement. Many of the &#8220;successes&#8221; touted for chemotherapy amount to an average survival improvement of only three months. It calls into question the whole existing definition of &#8220;success&#8221;.  FDA defines an effective chemotherapy treatment as one that achieves a 50% or greater reduction in measurable tumour mass for 28 days. It does not assess whether disease progression is halted or life is prolonged. To the Oncologist, effectiveness is defined by the degree to which a therapy can be endorsed without fear of legal repercussion.<br />\nJohn C. Bailar wrote, &#8220;We have given it our best effort for decades: billions of dollars of support, the best scientific talent available. It hasn&#8217;t paid off.&#8221;<br />\nDr. Contreras speaks of having written on the subject himself for years and still feels that chemotherapy, if used as the primary weapon against cancer, is wrong and generally bad for the patient. He cites three things he calls undeniable facts, though I must add here that none are absolute facts and preferably should be qualified. Well, in a handbook for the layperson, they are admittedly quite adequate as they are. They are that:<br />\n1. Chemotherapy tears down tumours fast;<br />\n2. Cancer cells mutate in ways that make them resistant to chemotherapy; and<br />\n3. Chemotherapy is toxic and causes serious side effects.<br />\nIn view of the speed with which toxic chemotherapy drugs can tear tumours down and in Dr. Contreras&#8217;s belief that no natural, non-toxic therapies can do that, he states that there is a legitimate place for chemotherapy in IRT as a secondary weapon (and I presume, a conditional one). In my personal view, it might only have depended upon the relative urgency of the patient&#8217;s condition IF it did not already require a certain amount of time to put the Oxidative Preconditioning Therapy into effect before administering chemotherapy.  Since it does, the relative speed at which chemotherapy works becomes moot in the light of the slightly slower, yet still much more potent efficacy of Acetogenins. These take a couple of days&#8217; administration to begin having significant effect, but can get a big head start on chemotherapy, because they do not require time spent on preconditioning, owing to their very high specificity to cancer tissues. I feel it still might leave a place in an integrated system for chemotherapy and certainly for new-generation TKIs, but I don&#8217;t otherwise warrant it to be a big role. What I do warrant is that all other treatment options should be fully explored BEFORE any chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery is resorted to. Meanwhile, in less urgent cases, the preconditioning is a great thing to do, even prior to commencing with Acetogenins. It would dramatically improve the dosage rate and duration of treatment with them, providing extra protection to even further reduce any risk of neurodegeneration.<br />\nBack to chemotherapy drugs: a mildly toxic one may destroy 99% of a moderately aggressive cancer, but the surviving 1% often mutates into a highly aggressive cancer that no longer responds to mildly toxic drugs. So drug manufacturers have allegedly had to develop a second and even third line of drugs, with each new line having increased toxicity and predictably more dangerous side effects. Tolerance to chemo varies widely. Some people die from exposure to the least aggressive chemotherapy drugs, whilst other people experience zero adverse reactions, even to drugs that are so toxic that those administering them must wear rubber gloves. Dr. Contreras lists many of the side effects typically caused by chemo drugs and states that a most dreaded one is Mucositis. It&#8217;s an inflammation of the mucous membranes in mouth and stomach that can lead to dangerously life-threatening diarrhoea and bleeding. Actually, knowing of several chemo drugs that cause Mucositis, I still didn&#8217;t imagine it could become that serious, but I do now.<br />\nAnyway, Dr. Contrearas asks:<br />\n\u201cWhat if there were ways to\u2026.<br />\n1. Leverage (potentiate) the cancer killing potential of chemotherapy;<br />\n2. Re-sensitise resistant tumours to mildly toxic chemotherapeutic drugs; and<br />\n3. Protect healthy cells from the onslaught of chemotherapy, thus reducing side effects to a minimum?\u201d<br />\nHe follows this up with discussions on doing just that, citing new discoveries, the use of natural nutrients in a variety of roles (as I, myself advocate) for protection, re-sensitisation, selective suppression or antisuppression and so on. In the use of chemotherapy drugs at Oasis Of Hope by qualified oncologists, two things distinguish it from oncology everywhere else. The first is the protective preconditioning therapy. The second is an umbrella of protection they create around their patients.<br />\nDr. Contreras quite rightly observes a serious contradiction in the existing orthodox benchmarks of success in cancer treatment. He states that much of the medical community is entrenched in thinking that deems a treatment successful, merely because it reduces the size of a tumour. Many such treatments shrink tumours, but do not extend the life of the patient, or secure quality of life for the patient.<br />\nThat is not success, or it is a meaningless success, at best, according to Dr. Contreras. I wholeheartedly agree.<br />\nLikewise, there are many in the medical community that would deem a treatment ineffective or a failure, merely because although it extends life and/or improves quality of life, it does not result in significant reduction of tumours. That is not failure. It is a meaningful, if limited or qualified success. Again, I wholeheartedly agree, although I definitely prefer an unqualified success! I don&#8217;t doubt for a second that Dr. Contreras feels likewise.<br />\nHe recounts the following to illustrate this.<br />\n&#8220;This whole concept became crystal clear to me when I accompanied my father to a prestigious cancer treatment center in New York to review his cases.\u201d<br />\nI suspect he refers to Memorial Sloan-Kettering, but Dr. Contreras diplomatically refrains from naming the institution.<br />\nHe continues, \u201cMy dad put a number of X-rays up for review but the oncologists were confused, if not annoyed. My dad&#8217;s patients still had tumours. One oncologist said, &#8216;Your treatment has failed! The patient still has a tumour. Let me show you one of my patient&#8217;s X-rays.&#8217; The oncologist put up before and after films and explained, &#8216;See, the tumour is gone. Now, that is success.&#8217; My father exclaimed, &#8221;That is wonderful! How is the patient, now?&#8217; The oncologist replied, &#8216;The patient died soon after the treatment.&#8217; My father stated, &#8216;My patient is still alive after five years even though there is some cancer left.&#8217; The oncologist said, &#8216;That is still a failure&#8217;. This experience with my father helped me redefine our treatment goals. Tumour destruction would no longer be sufficient. We would fight to help our patients live longer and stronger.&#8221;<br />\nI wish to point out here that with that particular oncologist&#8217;s way of thinking being so common in orthodox cancer medicine, you shouldn&#8217;t wonder why I call them butchers, quacks and poison peddlers. These people must be eradicated from the system \u2013 they are themselves cancerous.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5943\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5943\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5943\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 11:00 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5943#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5943\", \"5943\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>6. Regulating Healthy Cell Behaviour</p>\n<p>This chapter expands upon the basic description of Cell Signal Transduction Therapy. The behaviour of our body&#8217;s cells is tightly regulated to ensure that each cell acts in a way that supports the health of the whole body. But acquired alterations of a cell&#8217;s genetic material can disrupt the intricate internal mechanisms that govern cell behaviour, causing the cell to multiply and spread in ways that are detrimental or even lethal to the body. These rogue cells form the basis of cancer. The last several decades has seen molecular biology gradually unravel the way in which the cells work. &#8220;Signal Transduction&#8221; refers to the way in which cellular proteins undergo small and usually reversible changes in their structure to induce alterations in cell behaviour. Genetic material in cancer cells is typically altered in ways that overactivate  intracellular signal transduction mechanisms, specifically, the ones related to the malignant behaviour of cancer. Some of these prevent the process of apoptosis as well as support cellular multiplication, tissue invasion and metastasis; and the resistance to being killed by cytotoxic agents or radiation. Cell Signal Transduction Therapy seeks to regulate the signalling pathways in cancer cells to make them kill and control. This approach involves the use of nutrients, phytochemicals derived from plants and some currently available drugs to suppress signal transduction that promotes abnormal cell behaviour; and also to enhance signal transduction that promotes healthy cell behaviour. Among the substances used at Oasis Of Hope are Omega-3 Fatty Acids from fish oil, Silibinin, Green Tea Extract (containing EGCG &amp; other Phenols), Boswellic Acids, Salsalate, Diclofenac and Disulfiram.<br />\nThere is a dissertation at this point in the book on NF-Kappa-Beta and its multiple roles in carcinogenesis; and upon those of Cox-2, EGF-R, 5-LPO, IGF-1and VEGF. Of course, it discusses ways of regulating them and the mechanisms involved, describing how using these various nutrients, safe drugs and phytochemicals actually work. Although I do not reproduce those details here, they are mainly consistent with other research findings I have made and mainly utilise substances that I typically endorse in HICS. Many of these are detailed in other parts of Cancer&#8217;s Answers \u2013 the Synoptic List, specialised agents lists and in several chapters on Alternative Medicine.<br />\nSignificant ones are Omega-3, Silibinin, EGCG, other Phenols (Flavonoids, etc.) and Boswellic Acids.<br />\nSalsalate is a safer equivalent of Aspirin; Diclofenac is a pharmaceutical Cox-2 anti-inflammatory drug commonly marketed as Voltaren, that has relatively minor impact on Cox-1 (I have used this drug to control tendonosis in a shoulder joint to moderate benefit without any ill effects); and Disulfiram, a pharmaceutical inhibitor of NF-Kappa-Beta and proteasomes. These are protein enzymes that break proteins down. They are responsible for degrading a particular protein that inhibits NF-Kappa-Beta activation. Disulfiram renders cancer cells less aggressive and more susceptible to eradication and is apparently fairly well tolerated in the usual clinical doses. I endorse all of these except that I have some reservations about Salsalate because although safer than Aspirin, it can still increase risk of internal haemorrhage; Diclofenac in certain patients because it increases risk of heart attack; and Disulfiram because I have not extensively researched it. It happens that there are many other agents that will perform similar roles.</p>\n<p>7. A Balance Of Give And Take</p>\n<p>This chapter expands upon the Redox Regulatory Therapy. Redox is jargon for Reduction/Oxidation \u2013 the chemical reaction process of losing or gaining electrons and the normally resulting recombination of elements or compounds into new chemical compounds. This therapy is about selectively regulating activities of free radicals to ensure a good balance. Free radicals (whether reductive or oxidative) can be damaging or beneficial, depending on location, concentration and other variables. Chronic imbalance can result in such conditions as Oxidative Stress. The therapy includes selectively inducing intolerable levels of oxidative stress in cancer tissues \u2013 H2O2 is very effective in this regard when directly introduced to tumours, but intravenous infusion takes it via the blood, where antioxidant components might neutralise some of it. It is also hazardous, when directly infused to the blood in high concentrations, as is true with Ozone. That approach yields somewhat limited benefit at safe concentrations and too much systemic toxicity at higher levels.<br />\nThus, amongst other things, the therapy includes high-dose Vitamin C, supplemented with Vitamin K3. These break down in cancer tissues to produce Hydrogen Peroxide right there inside the tumours and it is becoming apparent that H2O2 has a natural part to play in human biochemistry \u2013 it is produced and used by the body in certain circumstances. Ozone therapy via O3-AHT is also used in this phase of treatment.<br />\nThese treatments don&#8217;t always work, since some tumours for example can produce larger amounts of Catalase and so neutralise more H2O2.<br />\nAnother possible failure can result from lack of Oxygen in the malignant tissues, but this too can be overcome by enriching Oxygen supply and this introduces a new synthetic Porphyrin compound called Perftec. It does nothing but carry and release Oxygen, just as Haemoglobin does.<br />\nOther kinds of supplements to assist the effectiveness are electron transfer catalysts.<br />\nIncidentally, the Vitamin C is infused intravenously. Oral ingestion, even in high doses, is ineffective. It was by administering lower doses and by doing so orally that C. G. Moertel of Mayo Clinic contrived in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to discredit Linus Pauling&#8217;s work with Vitamin C. 30 years later, clearly verified science is coming to light in powerful support of Dr. Pauling. Vitamin C trials are not the only ones that Moertel and Mayo Clinic deliberately fudged, either. Who should be surprised?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5944\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5944\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5944\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 11:07 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5944#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5944\", \"5944\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>8. Internal Security Team</p>\n<p>This chapter expands upon the Immune System Stimulation element of IRT. It discusses the function of the Immune System and a number of substances used at Oasis Of Hope to enhance its function, or to overcome the immunosuppressant agents that malignancies produce to protect themselves against immune response.<br />\nDr. Contreras introduces Melatonin, a substance that is listed in my Synoptic List as a hormone that stimulates immune activity. According to Dr. Contreras, a simple breakdown of what it does is to stimulate Dendritic Cells to produce greater amounts of Interleukin-2. NK &amp; T-Cells are activated as a result.<br />\nProbiotics consisting of special strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are another important element and again, they activate NK &amp; T-Cells from within the gut. This is because the Dendritic Cells recognise the polysaccharides making up the bacterial external membranes as foreign material produced by invading bacteria. They respond appropriately.<br />\nSupplemental Selenium is used.  It sparks an increase in the capacity of NK &amp; T-Cells to express more receptors for Interleukin-2. When this happens, they grow in greater abundance.<br />\nCimetidine is an anti-ulcer drug that Oasis Of Hope Hospital also uses as an immunosupportive agent that stimulates NK &amp; T-Cells, but also reduces the risk of metastasis in many cancers.<br />\nDoctor Contreras doesn&#8217;t mention other types of polysaccharides such as those in mushrooms or certain seaweeds, be they Glucans, Mannans, Fructans or Lignans; the powerful androgen DHEA, or Tuftsin (a tetrapeptide); but he does mention Silibinin, a Flavonolignan from Blessed Milk Thistle. All of these are immunomodulators.<br />\nThe other half of the immunomodulation equation is that of overcoming immunosppressors. Tumours use these to survive against the action of the Immune System. One mechanism cancer cells use to suppress the Immune System is a special cell called a T-reg Cell. These are special lymphocytes that often colonise tumours and kill or disable attacking immune cells by producing immunosuppressive factors. My personal belief is that these are probably microbe-infected T-Cell lymphocytes. Metronomic Chemotherapy, as it is called, is extremely useful for controlling T-reg Cells. They are exquisitely sensitive to being killed by small doses of chemotherapy drugs. The doses are too small to harm other immune cells, or cause other side effects. This is a rare case where chemotherapy actually helps to boost the immune system&#8217;s function, instead of suppressing it.<br />\nDiclofenac is used to inhibit production of an enzyme called Cox-2. This is commonly produced by cancer cells and in turn, it produces immunosuppressive compounds called Prostaglandins. Cox-2 also causes inflammation, which is why Diclofenac is used as an anti-inflammatory. It assists the Immune System by blocking the tumour&#8217;s Cox-2 immune suppression mechanism.<br />\nCaffeine is used because Adenosine is an immunosuppressant produced in many tumours, especially in poorly oxygenated regions. The energising effects of Caffeine are evidence of Caffeine&#8217;s ability to block the activation of Adenosine receptors in the brain. I surmise that Theobromine and Theophylline from Cacao (Chocolate) may do the same. Caffeine has the same potential in tumours, offsetting the immunosuppressive effects of Adenosine.<br />\nI indicated that Dr. Contreras didn&#8217;t mention the use of certain seaweeds (like Kombu) as immunomodulators, but Oasis Of Hope does use Arthrospira bacteria (Spirulina) in an anti-immunosuppressive role.<br />\nThe moderately oxidative environment found in many tumours is extremely toxic to NK &amp; T-Cells, impairing their tumour killing capabilities and even killing them. Most of this oxidative stress is generated by a specific enzyme complex. A key phytonutrient found in Spirulina is a Pyrrole related to Porphyrins called Phycocyanobilin. It\u2019s a potent inhibitor of that specific immunosuppressive enzyme complex that creates oxidative stress and is produced in tumours. Phycocyanobilin gets at the root of oxidative stress. Spirulina also contains polysaccharides that stimulate the Immune System and can act directly on some cancer cells to slow their growth and spread.  Further, it interferes with angiogenesis, so Spirulina acts in four ways.</p>\n<p>9. Healing Foods And Motion</p>\n<p>This chapter expands on the Diet and Exercise components of IRT. It happens that a lot of people acting on the guidance of various weight loss gurus still fail to lose weight and keep it off. Many people are also under the illusion that they &#8220;know&#8221; enough about good nutrition to maintain good health. And the media bombards us with this and that diet, etcetera, etcetera. The actual concepts are more complex. Oasis Of Hope knows something most of us don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s Insulin. Now, the presence of two hormones \u2013 Insulin and its related compound, Insulin-like Growth Factor-1, directly correlate to the incidence of some cancers. Controlling levels of these hormones is one of the more important aspects of an anticancer regimen.<br />\nThere is also a correlation of risk for most cancers with the proportion of dietary calories provided by animal products. An ongoing study in rural China conducted by Cornell University spanning more than 20 years involved people who ate a primarily plant-based diet. The study revealed a big difference in cancer incidence amongst these people when compared with people in western industrialised countries.<br />\nWhat is indicated by Dr. Contreras here is that animal proteins, animal fats, processed sugars and white flour boosts production of these two hormones. At Oasis Of Hope, high levels of these hormones in the bloodstream have been linked to the rapid multiplication of mutated cells.<br />\nTherefore, the connection is clear. They block the natural process of cell apoptosis. This assertion was verified by a UCLA study employing the Pritikin Diet-exercise program. Where physical activity is concerned, its impact upon cancer treatment was powerfully illustrated in recent studies of women with breast cancer. Breast cancers are very sensitive to Insulin activity and women with high levels of Insulin have a far poorer prognosis than those with low levels. Other studies have also demonstrated that daily aerobic exercise improves insulin sensitivity. The effect is a substantial reduction in the risk of breast and colorectal cancer mortality of 50% or more.<br />\nFurthermore, it has a favourable impact on the Immune System&#8217;s function and is beneficial prior to, or even during cytotoxic treatment like chemotherapy. It tends to counteract the fatigue that often associates with such therapies and thus improves the quality of life. IRT encourages patients to make lifestyle changes with regard to diet and exercise, which reduce the levels of Insulin and free IGF-1. A Vegan or quasi-Vegan diet of mostly vegetables, whole grain and fruits with fish oil is best. For those who find it too great a change, a &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; diet is a good intermediate stage.<br />\nMoreover, certain vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, onions and garlic cause the body&#8217;s cells to produce higher levels of antioxidants.<br />\nSpirulina is essential. I also recommend DHEA, the tetrapeptide Tuftsin and also mushrooms, like Coriolus, Agaricus, Reishi, Maitake &amp; Shiitake, plus Kombu seaweed, if you can get it; plus of course, those probiotic bacteria. All these promote stronger Immune System activity in response to their polysaccharide or other \u201cforeign\u201d constituency, even though they are themselves benign; or else they act in other ways to enliven immune activity.<br />\nOasis Of Hope will educate patients thoroughly in all these matters, including a huge range of other foods not mentioned here. Once a week at the hospital, the staff prepares a cultural food festival, celebrating cuisine and culture from one of the world&#8217;s countries. The dining hall has been turned into a slice of Spain, Mexico, Germany, Japan, China, Italy and many other countries on different occasions. Enjoyment that the patients find in these social mealtimes is also very therapeutic.<br />\nThe remainder of this chapter contains recipes. When it becomes possible, I will endeavour to reproduce these in the appropriate appendix of Cancer&#8217;s Answers. I will also add here that there is an apparent compatibility conflict with IPT (Insulin Potentiation Therapy) and IHT (Insulin-induced Hypoglycaemic Therapy).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5945\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5945\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/134a2ac1cdde766334851a3a8f517701?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">Mad Prof</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5945\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 21, 2013 at 11:16 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5945#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5945\", \"5945\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mad Prof'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>10. A Healthy Perspective</p>\n<p>This chapter expands on the Emotional Support component of IRT.<br />\nDr. Contreras opens this chapter with a description of something he observed himself when watching television. A 6&#8242; 3&#8243; tall Indian Guru, using his mind over body discipline, squeezed himself into a 2&#8242; by 2&#8242; by 2&#8242; glass box. We often hear of people walking on burning coals and various other strange happenings. Elsewhere in Cancer&#8217;s Answers, I also cite such cases as the Medicineless Miracle performed by three Buddhist Avatars in a Chinese hospital, where they made a large tumour disappear in 2 \u00bd minutes; and Russian Scientist Poponin&#8217;s discovery of the DNA Phantom Effect. These phenomena must surely force us to reassess what we usually tend to think of as &#8220;impossible&#8221;.<br />\nI want to point out in further support of the Contreras principle of applying both Emotional and Spiritual Support in IRT, that it has been proven by molecular biologists that mood hormones produced in the brain&#8217;s Hypothalamus directly influence the tightness of DNA helical twist. This in turn directly influences the way in which the DNA is able to separate for RNA transcription, due to torsional stress. That in turn governs cellular behaviour. In short, negative emotion begets negative results and positive emotion begets positive results.<br />\nIn light of this, I would actually like to see Oasis Of Hope enhance their Emotional Support program further by integrating Meditation into it, if it is not already in use. Certainly, they do use Prayer, which is a form of Meditation, but the more strings on the bow, the better. It is not hard to teach the methodology and for some people (though not all), Hypnotherapy offers similar benefits. Well, perhaps they do apply this science already in some way, since Dr. Contreras mentions Psychoneuroimmunology and Psychoneuroimaging.<br />\nOne thing is certain. Oasis Of Hope definitely appreciates and works to harness the power of the human mind, particularly at the subconscious level, through which it all becomes possible. He illuminates the power of perspective in this chapter and emphasises that one should not shoulder the burden alone. It is true that when other minds and hearts are with the patient and working with the patient towards a common goal, the effect is amplified tremendously. Contreras also teaches patients to deal more comfortably with other people whose empathy does not affect them positively. So many people are uncomfortable in the presence of a person living with cancer and find difficulty relating to the patient in the right kinds of positive ways. That can rub off on the patient and have negative effects, such as social withdrawal. Oasis teaches how to adjust one&#8217;s outlook, how to focus on the positives, how to surround one&#8217;s self with the right people and how to perceptually filter out the negative feedback.</p>\n<p>11. True Hope, True Healing</p>\n<p>This chapter expands upon the Spiritual Support component of IRT.<br />\nNow, at Contreras, this is framed mainly around spirituality in the mainstream Roman Catholic perspective. Therefore, there is a focus upon the principle that, &#8220;Everything that takes place in the physical world is a reflection of what happens in the spiritual world.&#8221; This also holds true across almost every other religion and among the beliefs of many Agnostics, too. &#8220;If you are filled with the fruit of the Spirit (love, peace, joy, gentleness, goodness, faith, temperance and so on), your spirit will be balanced and healthy. If you suffer from hatred, discord, jealousy, rage, selfishness or lack of forgiveness, then you have issues to work through to restore your spiritual health.&#8221; So Oasis helps patients to take a moment to evaluate their spiritual lives. People need to consider the physiological impact of choosing to live in a manner that creates spiritual disequilibrium (imbalance). The Oasis approach encourages patients to:<br />\nEvaluate their relationship with God;<br />\nAcknowledge areas in need of healing;<br />\nSeek direction and healing from God;<br />\nEmbrace their true identity in Christ;<br />\nEstablish a Godly purpose for living;<br />\nForgive others including themselves;<br />\nAdopt Godly thoughts and behaviours.<br />\nEven I, a supposedly godless heathen, acknowledge the significance of all these things \u2013 I merely interpret them a little differently, while retaining their essence of intent. And don&#8217;t worry \u2013 Oasis, whilst unashamedly Christian, welcomes people of all persuasions and makes them feel at home and cared for, without forcing their belief upon anyone. This chapter is concluded with Dr. Contreras speaking of Eternal Healing. In the scheme of this, the erasure of the fear of death and the emplacement of a faith in what lies beyond our corporeal phase of life both have their parts to play in IRT.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-5950\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-5950\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">THIS IS ALL SHIT</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-5950\">\n\t\t\t\tJuly 22, 2013 at 7:23 am</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=5950#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5950\", \"5950\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to THIS IS ALL SHIT'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>1.You are now stretching any figment of reality here. &#8220;Tumours disappearing&#8221;

A New Hope</p>\n<p>\u201cFor some, the only thing that matters is the bottom line.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are some statistics provided by Contreras Hospital on their patient survival rates, repeated from Chapter 3D. The first set of three-year stats came to me via the Oasis publication, \u201cHope \u2013 Medicine &amp; Healing\u201d early in 2010 and the second from the Oasis website late in 2011. I have reproduced only the stats of the second 5-year table here. They disclose figures for two Integrative Medicine institutions, Oasis IRT, CTCA IM and the USA national average from the US Seer Monograph. Numbers are percentage survival at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th years respectively.</p>\n<p>Contreras IRT:<br />\nBreast (no prior chemo treatment elsewhere): 100, 90, 83, 78, 75<br />\nBreast (prior chemo treatment elsewhere): 93, 73, 60, 51, 45<br />\nLung: 82, 50, 27, 23, 9<br />\nOvarian: 94, 87, 74, 60, 54<br />\nColorectal: 72, 48, 26, 17, 16</p>\n<p>CTCA IM:<br />\nBreast: 88, 63, 46<br />\nLung: 37, -, &#8211;<br />\nOvarian: 68, -, &#8211;<br />\nColorectal: 68, -, &#8211;<br />\nCTCA had only been operating three years, specialising in breast cancer and one year with the other cancer types.</p>\n<p>National Average:<br />\nBreast: 65, 44, 32, 25, 20<br />\nLung: 20, 6, 3, 2, 1.6<br />\nOvarian: 62, 43, 30, 23, 18<br />\nColorectal: 43, 22, 13, 10, 7</p>\n<p>Dr. Contreras here writes, \u201cThe Oasis Of Hope clinical research team developed IRT, integrating a number of therapies in order to overcome the barriers to effective cancer treatment and provide an umbrella of protection to healthy cells. Our success rates show we are headed in the right direction. Not all of our patients are cured, but most enjoy an improved quality of life and increased longevity. In fact, most live much longer than previously anticipated.\u201d And so the bottom line he offers the would-be patient comes in the form of a modest table of statistics. It shares the 3-year results of an ongoing 5-year study with Oasis patients that have breast, lung, ovarian or colorectal cancers.<br />\nAlso included are the national average survival rates, mainly comprising patients receiving \u201cconventional treatment\u201d in the USA. Those USA statistics are the \u201cGold Standard\u201d in cancer treatment. Personally, I prefer to call them the \u201cMud Standard\u201d. They don\u2019t even stack up well against the otherwise poor standard of orthodox cancer treatment in Britain, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and probably Canada. The statistics were taken from the NCI\u2019s SEER Survival Monograph for 2007. They do indeed indicate that Oasis is on the right path, for Oasis patients are doing far better than those receiving the average standard of care in the US.<br />\nIn particular, the survival rate of patients with lung cancer was strikingly better than average \u2013 about ten times better at three years. Dr. Contreras indicates they\u2019re not doing so well with colorectal cancer because it is typically resistant to currently available chemotherapies, again at three years. Despite that fact, the results are still twice as good as the average. I strongly believe that can be radically improved with Acetogenins, because they are the decisive answer to resistant cancers. Note also that the results for breast cancer patients who came to Oasis Of Hope soon after diagnosis are quite good, with more than double the 3-year survival percentage of patients who opted for conventional therapy alone. Oasis patients are clearly doing better.<br />\nContreras doesn\u2019t claim they have been \u201ccured\u201d in the sense that cancer has been eliminated and won\u2019t come back, but they are certainly outliving all previous expectations and are additionally enjoying lifestyle that is effectively rendered impossible under purely conventional therapy for most such patients. It\u2019s a far more palatable option than becoming a meaningless success by enduring highly toxic treatments that successfully shrink tumours, but destroy quality of life and fail to significantly extend the life of the patient.</p>\n<p>Based on the original three-year stats, I generated survival projection curves to ten years. When the five-year stats came in, its predictions at five years were very accurate. In Cancer\u2019s Answers, these show as visual curve graphs. They cannot be reproduced here without a lot of editing.</p>\n<p>Oasis also shifts the perspective of patients to embrace the concept that living with cancer does not mean facing imminent death and no matter what the statistics say, reality is dictated by perceptions. Remember that most people who are diagnosed with cancer had the disease lingering within them for a considerable time \u2013 even years before the diagnosis. And they probably didn\u2019t even feel particularly ill until the latter stages, prior to diagnosis. In some cases, they might not have felt too terrible until they were diagnosed. Then they suddenly perceive their world crashing down around them.</p>\n<p>I agree that\u2019s a perception thing and the imminent threat of death is actually something that has been cultivated by the use of viciously toxic chemotherapy drugs and other horrendous conventional treatments that work dually to: destroy quality of life; and fail to control the cancer satisfactorily towards some semblance of longevity with a minimum of discomfort. It is why I call them butchers, even if Dr. Contreras doesn\u2019t.<br />\nBut as Doctor Francisco Contreras says, \u201cWhen your being is no longer determined, nor defined by cancer, you are a cancer victor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift; and that is why it is called the present.\u201d (Eleanor Roosevelt)</p>\n<p>The remainder of the book\u2019s contents comprise 202 references to scientific papers and that kind of stuff, plus contact information and a DVD offer.</p>\n<p>This is the contact information:<br />\nOasis Of Hope<br />\nToll free from USA: 1-888-500-HOPE<br />\nDirect: 1 (619) 690-8450<br />\nFax: 1 (619) 690-8410<br />\nToll free from Mexico: 01-1800-026-2747<br />\nDirect in Mexico: 664-631-6124<br />\nFax in Mexico: 664-631-6154<br />\nEmail: health at oasisofhope com<br />\nWebstite: www oasisofhope com</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in Cancer\u2019s Answers, I have an older quote or two from Oasis Of Hope\u2019s Dr. Ernesto Contreras, I think. Oasis used DMSO and Laetrile in those days and reported good results, also unequivocally stating that there was nothing better than Laetrile for cancer prevention. However, you might have noted that DMSO and Laetrile are not even mentioned in this more current literature from Contreras Hospital, except where I inserted my own remarks about them. It happens that Oasis does offer Laetrile Therapy to patients who request it, but DMSO is not mentioned and I presume it is no longer used. Laetrile Therapy is not a standard component of IRT. It\u2019s a corollary option. How they stand with Laetrile\u2019s use and the Law in California is presently unclear, but I imagine California recently might have become one of the states which better respects the rights of patients to choose their treatments. It wasn\u2019t always legal in that state. I am by no means sure of the reasons why Laetrile is used and DMSO is not, but if I have the opportunity, I will endeavour to find out.</p>\n<p>That Oasis largely discontinued DMSO-Laetrile Therapy may be due to any of the following possibilities:<br />\nDMSO and Laetrile may have been made redundant by more effective therapies now used in IRT.<br />\nCurrent therapies used in IRT may be safer than DMSO and Laetrile therapy.<br />\nCurrent IRT therapies may be both more effective AND less harmful than DMSO-Laetrile Therapy.<br />\nOasis Of Hope has established itself within the United States in recent years (circa 2006), while apparently continuing to operate in Mexico. American states do not permit the use of DMSO for treating cancer, at all, whilst less than half of those states allow the use of Laetrile. Federal medical control authorities oppose its use outright.<br />\nCirca 2001, federal medical regulation instrumentalities from within the US extended their cancer policing activities into Mexico in cooperation with the Mexican government, in their attempts to \u201cclean up\u201d the cancer treatment business there. There was a particular focus on the many shoddy medical operations; and according to one report from R. Webster Kehr, they attempted to stop the use of Amygdalin or Laetrile in cancer therapy throughout Mexico, as well. The FDA\u2019s action against DMSO in Mexico is not mentioned in the same literature \u2013 but it seems probable, that is, in addition to the emplacement of a number of restrictions upon hospitals or clinics to use \u201cexperimental treatments\u201d only if granted government permit to do so and a limit of six patients. Further, I speculate that they moved against \u201cLaetrile\u201d production facilities in Mexico, noting as I say this, that product quality varied widely from one production facility to another. It was always natural Amygdalin extracted from apricot pips in any case \u2013 not true artificial Laetrile, which has only ever been manufactured in the USA and Germany. In doing so, I hold forth a small possibility that Oasis Of Hope gained a foothold on American soil conditionally \u2013 possibly being upon agreement to discontinue the use of DMSO-Laetrile therapy, perhaps on both sides of the border. It is no sleight against Oasis Of Hope \u2013 they do what they can with what they have and what is permitted them, but I definitely have very poor confidence in American bureaucracy to be doing entirely the right thing for entirely the right reasons. In short, I think they stink.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-6019\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-6019\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5bd121a02338ad61323a3a1dcfe73b?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.natecreed.com/blog/?attachment_id=164&#038;cpage=1' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>web page</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-6019\">\n\t\t\t\tAugust 4, 2013 at 8:10 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=6019#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6019\", \"6019\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to web page'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Do you mind if I quote a few of your posts as<br />\nlong as I provide credit and sources back to your blog?<br />\nMy blog is in the exact same niche as yours and my users would genuinely benefit from some of the information you present<br />\nhere.

In addition, spontaneous cure rate is about<br />\n30% , survival is 5 years with treatment and 5+ without.  So life is a risk<br />\nHowever, once faced with cancer learning what is available takes time and<br />\npatience, research and knowledge about one&#8217;s particular case.  After reading all the clinical trials, which is a daunting task, with the statistical<br />\noutcomes. At this moment in time, everything is on the table and are being explored to cure cancer and for anyone to disregard diet, exercise, naturopathy, conventional as well as unconventional remedies. Anyone,<br />\nwith intelligence and cancer wants the best outcome. I will tell you all treatments are not equal and money is the root cause for achieving<br />\na good treatment! I have cancer and the journey is fraught with maybe,<br />\nyou can&#8217;t do that !  I say lets try, don&#8217;t wait for stage 4 on the death bed!<br />\nDo not let fear, override logical experience. Truth sometimes upsets<br />\nconventional medicine, no one likes to be wrong when professional ego is<br />\nchallenged and money.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"post pingback\">\n\t\t<p>Pingback: <a href='http://themagicinlife.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/more-on-black-salve-and-escharotics/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>More on Black Salve, and Escharotics | The Magic in Life</a></p>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-6353\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-6353\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5464aefa350141f1a20dc8f9713a8d06?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://Blip.fm/profile/steelmass6' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>sage hill townhomes</a></cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-6353\">\n\t\t\t\tOctober 7, 2013 at 3:37 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=6353#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6353\", \"6353\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to sage hill townhomes'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>It is perfect time to make some plans for the future and it&#8217;s time to<br />\nbe happy.

Human lung diploid fibroblasts served as noncancerous control cells. The presence of ozone at 0.3 to 0.5 part per million inhibited cancer cell growth 40 and 60 percent, respectively. The noncancerous lung cells were unaffected at these levels. Exposure to ozone at 0.8 part per million inhibited cancer cell growth more than 90 percent and control cell growth less than 50 percent. Evidently, the mechanisms for defense against ozone damage are impaired in human cancer cells.<br />\nPMID: 7403859<br />\n    [PubMed &#8211; indexed for MEDLINE] </p>\n<p>Ozone forms several peroxides, hydrogen peroxide with reaction with water and lipid peroxides with reaction with fatty acids. These fatty acids include the fatty acids found in the cell membranes. The peroxides generated enter in to both healthy and cancerous cells. But the antioxidant enzymes in the healthy cells break these peroxides down in to water and oxygen. The cancerous cells though lack these enzymes and therefore can not break down the peroxides. Because they are not broken down the peroxides continue entering the cancer cells causing them to swell like a water balloon until they burst. For this reason the ozone selectively kills cancer cells, but not healthy cells.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n\n\t<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-6525\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-6525\">\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ccd437928d03eaff4816d06e4082304?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\n\t\t\t<cite class=\"fn\">mdmurray</cite>\n\n\t\t\t<span class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\">\n\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/#comment-6525\">\n\t\t\t\tNovember 24, 2013 at 3:12 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://thetruthergirls.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/black-salve/?replytocom=6525#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6525\", \"6525\", \"respond\", \"622\" )' aria-label='Reply to mdmurray'>Reply</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>your explanation just doesnt make any sense. The claim that is being made is that ozone is an effective proven safe treatment for cancer in humans.<br />\nYou have quoted one  paper from 33 years ago based on  a cell culture. You have then said that human cells arent affected as they dont have an enzyme which renders them immune to the action of ozone . Unless the concentration is slightly higher when in which case it kills half of human cells so your explanation doesn&#8217;t make any sense.<br />\nThis is a long time ago and in terms of modern research, eons&#8230;It involves cell culture not humans. it has not been repeated.<br />\nIn essence it is meaningless. Ozone has no proven benefit in cancer treatment and if this is the best you can do it &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />\nit is also not been given away or is it cheap.It doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; like most of the rubbish on here.

He used to go several times a year.<br />\nMy cousin and I followed the instructions on how to make black salve and did so ourselves. Since then we have given some to another cousin who had a leision that was to be cut by a doctor (on his scalp about the size of a 50cent piece) and a graft from his thigh to replace it.<br />\nHe tried balck salve , much to the anger of his surgeion, and within 2 weeks the cancer was gone. That was a year ago.<br />\n I have spoken to others who have used black salve too. Good news from all. They generally went on strict alkaline diets too. </p>\n<p>Must saw&#8230;it probably will be painful<br />\nMyself?? I used it on a wart I couldn&#8217;t get rid of for 30 years. Had to apply black salve twice&#8230;.. second application about 10 days after the first. The wart was gone shortly after&#8230;.lots of tingling,&#8230; but not real pain.

Fast and the chemo/rad are considered just to slow it down with not many records of even 5 year survival. White doctor from town gave her a year.<br />\nI think we are compelled to discuss the internal method because she is young, otherwise healthy/positive and this cancer has been aggressive, only being slowed by green tea and foods she was already eating.<br />\nOn the drawing board and by testimony, there should not be a live cancer cell after 21 days.
