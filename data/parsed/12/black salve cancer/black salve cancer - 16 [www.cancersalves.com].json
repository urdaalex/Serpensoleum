Indian Mud", "url": "http://www.cancersalves.com/botanical_approaches/individual_herbs/bloodroot.html", "actual-search-type": "f", "paragraphs": ["Photograph of bloodroot.This plant is indigenous to the Eastern region of the United States and Canada.", "It was used by Native Americans for treatment of cancer as well as moles and warts.", "It grows in the shade, away from the noise and traffic of civilization.", "It flowers briefly and then even its leaves yellow and disappear.", "It is not like some members of the plant kingdom that are more overt, showy, and grabby for attention.", "There is also a clinical side.", "In all my years with herbs, I have never seen any herb absorbed so fast into the blood stream as bloodroot.", "Some people become nauseous after rubbing just a little tincture of bloodroot on the arches of their feet.", "Bloodroot has been researched and determined to be a potent anticancer agent.", "Besides the laboratory tests, tens of thousands of people have been treated by lay practitioners as well as medical doctors for at least the last 150 years.", "Of these, roughly 80% experienced remission of malignancy and longer life expectancies than people with similar conditions who chose different treatments.", "Still, it is always a matter of individual choice, and for the 20% whose conditions were not ameliorated by bloodroot, it has to be said that the treatment is challenging and these people have every right to ask whether their efforts were warranted.", "Moreover, we never know before trying who will respond in the desired way and who will have to turn to some other treatment for relief.", "Bloodroot has significant anti-infective properties, so much so that it has been used in gangrenous situations in lieu of amputation.", "It has also traditionally been used on warts, fungoid tumors, nasal polyps, and periodontal infections, gingivitis, and plaque.", "With cancer, it has been shown to be most effective with carcinomas and sarcomas.", "My guess, and it is only a guess, is that many types of morbid conditions are highly reactive to bloodroot, this whether bloodroot is used internally or externally.", "My suspicion is that infection is just as reactive to bloodroot as cancer is.", "When bloodroot is applied externally to a morbid area, the treatment site often becomes very inflamed and immunologically active almost immediately.", "When taken internally, many people begin to experience eruptions on the skin within hours or days, suggesting that bloodroot is a powerful mobilizer of diseased matter.", "Where there is infection, toxicity, acidity, and various other conditions in the vicinity of the tumor, responses to bloodroot applications can take place in minutes and affect much more tissue than the actual site where the paste is applied.", "Then, depending on the product used and the skill of the person using the product, inflammation, pain, and ultimately scarring can be more than some people expect.", "It is for such reasons that I feel that most people should be treated by experts, people with experience in this particular treatment modality.", "Since reactions to bloodroot can be painful and highly inflammatory, it seems to me that those opting for this treatment need to be well-informed, prepared, resolute, and decisive.", "To me, it has never seemed like an option to start this treatment and quit though I know people who have started and then turned to surgery as well as those who interrupted the treatment for some weeks or months and later resumed it.", "The fact that they lived suggests that the treatment is not as dangerous as it looks, but it is also not for the faint of heart.", "Over the years, quite a number of people have asked me to help them after starting with a product without adequate prior preparation.", "Once in a while, someone was so persuasive that I tried to troubleshoot the issues that arose.", "However, what I want to say unequivocally is that this is a classic situation of, if I were you, I wouldn't start here.", "By the time people learn this, it is too late to start differently.", " Two others who also discovered my work after applying a bloodroot paste also ended up with surgery.", "I want to report these incidents because the reality is that most people who use the products are doing so not only for the first time in their lives but also at the most critical time.", "The fact that the process is not advisable in certain situations and apt to fail is not really a basis for not trying, merely for setting some objective standards by which to measure whether or not sufficient progress is being made to warrant putting off surgery.", "which is, in fact the usual alternative to escharotics.", "Whether further perseverance or greater skill in the use of the products would have served any of those whose efforts failed is really not for me to say.", "I respect the possibilities of this treatment and would, in fact, choose it for myself if I were the one with cancer, but the difference between my making such a decision and someone else making it is the depth of my understanding of the method and its potential versus that of a lay person buying a product from a web site that provides little or no information or guidance on the correct use of its products.", "Ironically, the one concern that doctors express, risk of infection, is the smallest worry of those experienced with this product.", "The treatment sites are sometimes infected prior to use of the escharotic.", "We know this because of the discoloration, odor, ulceration, exudations, and so forth that are often visible.", "However, I know of no situations in which someone became infected because of the use of escharotics.", " The inflammation that follows use of bloodroot is an immunological response that protects the open area from infection.", " Much of the material on this site is historic or ethnobotanical in origin.", "The information presented is not intended to replace the services of a qualified health care professional.", "in feedback, clinical data, suggestions, and proposals for research and product development.", "While we naturally hope for the happiest outcome in all situations, the authors of this web site, webmaster, server, publishers, and Sacred Medicine Sanctuary are not responsible for

After Kurt\n              Lerner took the photographs, the root, which was grown in my\n              garden in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was made into a poultice. I\n              have the greatest reverence for this plant, but it is not like\n              any other herb I know. I am deliberately saying this in an\n              intimate way.\n              <p>Bloodroot is a shy plant. It grows in the shade, away from\n                the noise and traffic of civilization. It likes moisture\n                and seclusion. It flowers briefly and then even its leaves\n                yellow and disappear. It is not like some members of the\n                plant kingdom that are more overt, showy, and grabby for\n                attention.</p>\n              If you break the root, a sap pours forth that looks like blood.\n              It even coagulates like blood. I channeled something on this\n              and was given a wealth of information, mainly suggesting that\n              people who are ready for an initiation of the spirit in which\n              they surrender themselves to the purposes of their own souls\n              and to God can be saved by this plant. Others should seek cures\n              for their conditions in other ways.</div>\n            <p align=\"center\" class=\"cs_subtitle\"> Bloodroot from a Clinical\n              Perspective</p>\n            <div align=\"left\">\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">That's the metaphysical side. There is also\n                a clinical side. Bloodroot is a systemic treatment. In all\n                my years with herbs, I have never seen any herb absorbed\n                so fast into the blood stream as bloodroot. Some people become\n                nauseous after rubbing just a little tincture of bloodroot\n                on the arches of their feet.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Bloodroot has been researched and determined\n                to be a potent anticancer agent. Besides the laboratory tests,\n                tens of thousands of people have been treated by lay practitioners\n                as well as medical doctors for at least the last 150 years.\n                Of these, roughly 80% experienced remission of malignancy\n                and longer life expectancies than people with similar conditions\n                who chose different treatments.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Still, it is always a matter of individual\n                choice, and for the 20% whose conditions were not ameliorated\n                by bloodroot, it has to be said that the treatment is challenging\n                and these people have every right to ask whether their efforts\n                were warranted. Moreover, we never know before trying who\n                will respond in the desired way and who will have to turn\n                to some other treatment for relief.</p>\n              <p align=\"center\" class=\"cs_subtitle\"> Bloodroot Scientifically</p>\n              <p align=\"left\"><img src=\"/images/herb_photographs/bloodrootground.jpg\" width=\"192\" height=\"164\" align=\"left\" alt=\"bloodroot mash\"> <span class=\"cs_text\">Bloodroot\n                  has significant anti-infective properties, so much so that\n                  it has been used in gangrenous situations in lieu of amputation.\n                  It has also traditionally been used on warts, fungoid tumors,\n                  nasal polyps, and periodontal infections, gingivitis, and\n                  plaque. With cancer, it has been shown to be most effective\n                  with carcinomas and sarcomas.</span></p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">In my estimation, not enough is known about\n                cancer. Even when a quite significant mass is analyzed, rarely\n                is more than 20% of the mass determined to be cancerous,\n                and in some cases, only a few atypical cells are found. The\n                rest of the tumor may consist of infectious material, parasites,\n                metabolic residuals, and other matter that is seldom described\n                by pathologists. We have no way of knowing how bloodroot\n                affects the <a href=\"/articles/physiological_terrain.html\">terrain</a> in\n                which the malignancies are harbored.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">My guess, and it is only a guess, is that\n                many types of morbid conditions are highly reactive to bloodroot,\n                this whether bloodroot is used internally or externally.\n                My suspicion is that infection is just as reactive to bloodroot\n                as cancer is. When bloodroot is applied externally to a morbid\n                area, the treatment site often becomes very inflamed and\n                immunologically active almost immediately. When taken internally,\n                many people begin to experience eruptions on the skin within\n                hours or days, suggesting that bloodroot is a powerful mobilizer\n                of diseased matter.</p>\n              <p align=\"center\" class=\"cs_subtitle\"> Bloodroot Treatment</p>\n              <div align=\"left\">\n                <p class=\"cs_text\">When there is no real definition of the\n                  treatment site, i.e., when no one really knows how extensive\n                  the malignancy or infection is, it is virtually impossible\n                  to anticipate the size or nature of the reaction to bloodroot.\n                  When bloodroot is mixed with zinc chloride&#151;as it usually\n                  is&#151;reactions can be violent and unpredictable. Elsewhere\n                  on this site, I <a href=\"http://www.cancersalves.com/speculations.html\">speculate</a> about\n                  how and why this happens. I suspect it is because the morbidity\n                  is extensive, i.e., not as localized as the tumorous mass\n                  itself. </p>\n                <p class=\"cs_text\">Where there is infection, toxicity, acidity,\n                  and various other conditions in the vicinity of the tumor,\n                  responses to bloodroot applications can take place in minutes\n                  and affect much more tissue than the actual site where\n                  the paste is applied. Then, depending on the product used\n                  and the skill of the person using the product, inflammation,\n                  pain, and ultimately scarring can be more than some people\n                  expect. It is for such reasons that I feel that most people\n                  should be treated by experts, people with experience in\n                  this particular treatment modality.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cs_subtitle\">Other Concerns</span><br>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div align=\"left\">\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Since reactions to bloodroot can be painful\n                and highly inflammatory, it seems to me that those opting\n                for this treatment need to be well-informed, prepared, resolute,\n                and decisive. To me, it has never seemed like an option to\n                start this treatment and quit though I know people who have\n                started and then turned to surgery as well as those who interrupted\n                the treatment for some weeks or months and later resumed\n                it. The fact that they lived suggests that the treatment\n                is not as dangerous as it looks, but it is also not for the\n                faint of heart. I personally believe that those using bloodroot\n                preparations are well-advised to destroy the entire tumor\n                as quickly as possible since I feel that inflammation and\n                irritation of the tumor can conceivably aggravate tumor growth. </p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Over the years, quite a number of people\n                have asked me to help them after starting with a product\n                without adequate prior preparation. Once in a while, someone\n                was so persuasive that I tried to troubleshoot the issues\n                that arose. However, what I want to say unequivocally is\n                that this is a classic situation of, &quot;if I were you,\n                I wouldn't start here.&quot; By the time people learn this,\n                it is too late to start differently.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Janis (not her real name) was one of the\n                people who contacted me after misusing a popular escharotic.\n                You can read her letter on the <a href=\"http://cancersalves.com/cgi-bin/discus/discus.cgi\" target=\"_blank\">bulletin\n                board</a> page. Her issue was scarring. I believe that the\n                amount of post-escharotic scarring is directly related to\n                infection and toxicity, some of which is probably systemic.\n                After several months on various anti-scarring products, Janis\n                made only nominal improvement.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Another person who asked quite a few questions\n                but was determined to follow the instructions that came with\n                the product rather than listening to my suggestions was an\n                MD who wound up with surgery. I recounted <a href=\"http://cancersalves.com/cgi-bin/discus/discus.cgi\" target=\"_blank\">her\n                story</a> also. I saw her once after more than four months\n                of determined effort that involved an unfamiliar process.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\"> Two others who also discovered my work\n                after applying a bloodroot paste also ended up with surgery.\n                I want to report these incidents because the reality is that\n                most people who use the products are doing so not only for\n                the first time in their lives but also at the most critical\n                time. The fact that the process is not advisable in certain\n                situations and apt to fail is not really a basis for not\n                trying, merely for setting some objective standards by which\n                to measure whether or not sufficient progress is being made\n                to warrant putting off surgery. . . which is, in fact the\n                usual alternative to escharotics.</p>\n              <p align=\"center\" class=\"cs_subtitle\"> In Sum</p>\n              <p> <span class=\"cs_text\">Whether further perseverance or greater\n                  skill in the use of the products would have served any\n                  of those whose efforts failed is really not for me to say.\n                  I respect the possibilities of this treatment and would,\n                  in fact, choose it for myself if I were the one with cancer,\n                  but the difference between my making such a decision and\n                  someone else making it is the depth of my understanding\n                  of the method and its potential versus that of a lay person\n                  buying a product from a web site that provides little or\n                  no information or guidance on the correct use of its products.</span></p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Ironically, the one concern that doctors\n                express, risk of infection, is the smallest worry of those\n                experienced with this product. The treatment sites are sometimes\n                infected prior to use of the escharotic. We know this because\n                of the discoloration, odor, ulceration, exudations, and so\n                forth that are often visible. However, I know of no situations\n                in which someone became infected because of the use of escharotics.\n                An immunologist explained this to me:</p>\n            </div>\n            <blockquote>\n              <div align=\"left\">\n                <p class=\"cs_text\"> The inflammation that follows use of\n                  bloodroot is an immunological response that protects the\n                  open area from infection.</p>\n              </div>\n            </blockquote>\n            <div align=\"left\">\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">Now that the <a href=\"/publications/book.html\">book</a> is\n                out, I no longer troubleshoot complications that occur as\n                a result of misadventures with escharotics . . . except to\n                the extent that I sometimes feel to comment on the <a href=\"http://cancersalves.com/cgi-bin/discus/discus.cgi\">bulletin\n                board</a>, a relatively recent addition to this site. I have\n                gone on record with adequate warnings, explained my personal\n                preferences in my book, provided instructions and formulae\n                in the book, and urged people to think through what they\n                are doing before taking steps that might be regretted. I\n                believe in the treatment, but not probably for the same reasons\n                as patients. I do not have a need to believe in it because\n                my life depends on the choices I make. I have a need to be\n                true to myself, my philosophy of healing, and my faith in\n                the goodness of Nature.</p>\n              <p class=\"cs_text\">This said, I cannot even begin to emphasize\n                the importance of the supportive measures. For me, external\n                use of bloodroot pastes is a last resort, not the first line\n                of assault in cancer treatment. Were I in the position of\n                needing to treat a lump in my body, I would use the <a href=\"/botanical_approaches/sms_formulas/herbal_tonics.html\">internal\n                tonics</a> for some months and then perhaps a <a href=\"/botanical_approaches/individual_herbs/goldenseal.html\">goldenseal</a> salve\n                on the lump. I feel I know enough to make such a decision\n                for myself; and many who have read my <a href=\"http://www.cancersalves.com/publications/book.html\"> book</a> also\n                feel well enough informed to understand the ramifications\n                of their choices. It is definitely possible to use bloodroot\n                or some other escharotic or enucleating product successfully,\n                but my sense is that those who succeeded without proper understanding\n                and preparation were lucky because the process usually requires\n                more skill than is present when first starting on this hugely\n                interesting and often dramatic treatment.</p>\n            </div>\n            <blockquote>\n              <blockquote>\n                <div align=\"left\"><!-- #BeginLibraryItem \"/library/book
