Neyman, Redoubt Reporter.", "Rick Abbott, manager of Spenard Builders Supply in Soldotna, shows a pillowcase given to him by kids in his church, which he took with him to a hospital in Mexico where he sought treatment for cancer.", "Not being a morose individual given to pessimistic thinking, Rick Abbott wasnt expecting some of the worst news of his life to come from that doctors visit in November 2011.", "This is, after all, the man behind the inspirational quotes posted on the sign in front of Spenard Builders Supply in Soldotna.", "This weeks offering: One thing you cant recycle is wasted time.", "As an optimist, he was hoping for a treatment plan to alleviate the neuropathy in his legs, pain in his joints, migraines, fatigue, nosebleeds and other health struggles that had been worsening.", "As a pragmatist, he was at least expecting an explanation of what was causing his symptoms.", "He got the latter, but in a form that would considerably test the former.", "The doctor said it just like that.", "She said, I have talked to a doctor group in Seattle for over an hour about your case.", "I havent been able to come up with a reason or a solution.", "I dont have a cure for you.", "When youre given that prognosis, what do you do?", "You dont panic, first of all.", "One doesnt maintain a successful business career as long as Abbott 40 years as general manager of Soldotna SBS and the old Superior Building Supply in Soldotna before that by falling to pieces when faced with a difficult situation.", "You measure up the problem and use the best tools available to address it.", "In this case, as with all in Abbotts life, that meant relying on his love for family and his strength of faith.", "I had a protective feeling of taking care of my wife (Phoebe), so I was trying to absorb what the doctor was saying, but more so I was trying to protect how she would receive this.", "But I know the Lord was protecting whatever feelings I was supposed to have.", "At that time I didnt have any fear or anxiety I had none of those, he said.", "What he did have was a spirit ingrained with hope, a mind open to the unconventional route along which that hope would lead him, a soul at peace with however that journey would turn out, and a wife who is every bit as strong in faith and resolve as he is.", "Dont give up and dont take no for an answer.", "Theres got to be something out there that can help, she said.", "But there wasnt, at least not in the U.S. After being diagnosed by an oncologist in Alaska, Abbott was referred to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.", "The news there, in January 2012, was just as grim.", "I told him (the doctor), Ive worked in a lumber yards for many years, so I deal with charts and graphs.", "If you can take what I have inside me and put it on a chart or graph and show me where it is is it on the left side of the graph, is it on the right, where is it?", "I said, Wherever it is, its OK with me, but if you could do that for me, thats what Im here for, Abbott said.", "The doctor obliged, but the placement was not good, and the prognosis even worse.", "They said it was terminal and that they couldnt do anything, Abbott said.", "As long as Abbott could stand the symptoms, he could go about his life.", "As the disease progressed to its final stage, doctors could give him targeted chemotherapy to help with the pain.", "I said, Will it kill the bad cells?", "I said, Will it kill the good cells?", "I said, Will the bad cells come back?", "I said, What about the good cells?", "He used the term shake and bake.", "Me being a salesman I thought, Hes got to come up with a different term, Abbott said.", "Rather than taking that as gospel, the Abbotts decided to seek other wisdom.", "Phoebe was particularly interested in a hospital in Mexico, International Bio Care, which a longtime family friend, Annette Meyer, had told her about.", "To Abbotts ears it sounded a little strange.", "This is a guy, after all, who lives in work boots and flannel shirts.", "His office is decorated with old hand tools.", "He works in ledgers and budgets, with lumber and inventory things that are reliably tangible, that can be measured, stacked and counted.", "He serves on the boards of the Kenai Peninsula Builders Association, Safari Club and Central Peninsula Hospital Foundation.", "And hes to traipse off to Tijuana to undergo a series of mystical-sounding treatments that are beyond the purview of U.S. medicine, outside the coverage of U.S. health insurance and pay for it out of pocket?", "(Meyer) told us about these treatments that were just neater than sliced bread.", "Phoebe said, We need to go to Mexico, we need to get all the facts that we possibly can.", "And Im more basic, so I didnt know, Abbott said.", "Phoebe, though, is more leaves and twigs, as the family lovingly, jokingly puts it.", "Im supportive of traditional medicine but I also know that preventative medicine is always a good thing.", "The kids used to pick on me because I was always into vitamins and things.", "The kids got tired of it as they got older, but now that theyre grown up theyll ask their mom if I have any leaves and twigs for various things.", "Ive always tried to do things the healthy way, she said.", "She called the hospital in Mexico and was immediately impressed.", "She had called after hours and there still was a doctor available to answer her questions.", "They offered to mail information to family members at no charge.", "They were helpful, courteous and friendly.", "And most of all, they offered hope.", "I called them and said he has this diagnosis and there wasnt much in the line of anything offered.", "Well, it was offered but there wasnt confidence that there would be any help.", "They would throw it at him and he would respond to it possibly, but he might not, so theyd try it again, another round, and still again.", "But it would just come back, she said.", "So I gave them the diagnosis and wondered if it was something they could treat.", "That single word was an answer to her prayers.", "They said, Absolutely we have things to offer.", "They said their success rate is high.", "And we, personally, have friends who have been there and highly recommended it.", "It was just a different approach.", "People in the central Kenai Peninsula had undergone treatment at the facility and now were cancer free, she said.", "Not friends of friends, or a cousins buddy, or a coworkers acquaintances husband.", "We see the benefits done for people.", "Weve seen people where (U.S.) doctors had given up on them and now theyre OK, Abbott said.", "And you ask the doctors there (in Mexico) and the bottom line is, no, not everybody makes it, so its not a magic place.", "And they would be very quick and clear to tell people that are there other hospitals than theirs that offer these treatments.", "But we heard of several people in this area who had received treatment there.", "And so we prayed about it.", "To sway Abbott even further was the sense he got that the hospital was truly out for his health, not his money.", "They said to Phoebe, Have him come down here, we can help him.", "She said their countenance was so different, so kind, and there are other people in this community who have already been there and are in remission.", "They did not say, What is his Social Security number, whats his credit card, how much money do you have, this is how much it is, blah, blah, blah.", "As a businessman, that spoke volumes to me, Abbott said.", "Comparatively, his cancer treatment was cheap $27,000 for everything, including three weeks of in-patient care.", "Just a bag of chemo (in the U.S.) costs, what, $6,000?", "But treatment in the U.S. would be eligible for health insurance coverage, whereas everything with the Mexico treatment would be out of his own pocket.", "So I went to my 401k, he said.", "When youre looking at life or death, and youve got three children, six grandchildren, a wife that youve been married to for however long (43 years, he clarified a fact that he does have readily available).", "To me its a win-win deal, whether you live or die anyway.", "Youve got people that you love and love you, so whats a 401k for?", "They flew to San Diego in February 2012 and were met by a hospital representative who drove them across the border and to the 28-bed hospital.", "When they checked in they found fresh fruit and water waiting for both of them a service that was refreshed daily throughout their stay.", "They figured itd be a day of waiting around and getting settled.", "And there was some getting settled seeing the area around the hospital in Tijuana, which seemed quite safe, and meeting other patients, some from Mexico, others from Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere, including some Amish and Mennonite people, Abbott said.", "But there was no waiting around.", "We figured, Theyll get us checked in and nothing will happen until the next day.", "I was really pretty surprised at that, that theyd do anything the first day, Phoebe said.", "Abbott underwent several procedures, including Alivizatos Treatment, named for the Greek doctor who pioneered the protocol.", "Its a 20-day infusion of vitamins, minerals and amino acids that is meant to regenerate and enhance the bodys immune system and modulate its metabolism so that it essentially starves cancer cells and encourages the reproduction of healthy cells.", "He was put on the accompanying Alivizatos Greek Treatment Diet low in acid and protein, encouraging drinking lots of alkaline water and avoiding preservatives, refined sugar, fat from meats, flour and alcohol and began chelation for detoxification.", "He had hyperbaric oxygen therapy daily and underwent three rounds of hyperthermia treatment, where his body temperature was raised to 108 degrees to stimulate the bodys response to fight off disease, as it would with a naturally occurring fever.", "When he first arrived at the hospital, Abbotts blood was drawn to create dendritic cell vaccines.", "The blood was sent off to Switzerland where it was treated, sent back to the hospital and sent home with Abbott to give himself two weeks of injections.", "The vaccines, as theyre called, stimulate his dendritic cells, which circulate in the blood and can latch onto invading pathogens, again helping his bodys immune response.", "I said going in, I want everything you can possibly give me, just pour it on, and they did, Abbott said.", "He said he doesnt know all the science behind it, how it works or what it does, but he knows he felt an immediate improvement.", "They returned home to Sterling late in the week, and he returned to work the following Monday.", "Above are images of Rick Abbotts white blood cells upon arriving at the International Bio Care Hospital in Mexico on Feb. 13, 2012.", "Notice that only one appears active, with a halo around it.", "Below are images when Abbott was discharged March 5, 2012, showing more of his white blood cells being active.", "My employees said that I looked much better, that I seemed much better.", "About two weeks after that I told my wife, Honey, I can feel my calf.", "Now, this wasnt even supposed to be part of the deal, but I dont have neuropathy anymore.", "Before being released, a doctor did a before-and-after review with Abbott, looking at his blood under a microscope.", "Upon arrival his red blood count was low, his white blood cells were inactive and a citrus layer around his cells (an indicator of immune system health) was thin, he said.", "When he left his red blood cells were up, his white blood cells were active and the citrus layer had deepened.", "I was so excited about that.", "In three weeks time they had gotten the white cells to work.", "Just that, alone, in three weeks time was amazing, Abbott said.", "The entire experience was all-around amazing, Phoebe said, from the care to the treatment to the results.", "Particularly comforting to the Abbotts was the spiritual encouragement they found at the hospital.", "Abbott took a pillowcase that students from his church had made him, covered in handprints and Biblical verses.", "Throughout his stay he felt supported in his faith and was able to support other patients in theirs, he said.", "Above is Abbotts citrus layer before treatment.", "Below, its much thicker after three weeks of treatment.", "They encourage you to exercise your faith there, Phoebe said.", "There were times when the IVs werent going really well, he was praying and the nurses were praying right with him.", "Since coming home, Abbott has offered himself as a resource of information about his experience, willing to talk to anyone about the nuts and bolts of his visit and treatment.", "Its a do-unto-others sort of thing.", "I know Ive had so many people praying for me, Abbott said.", "And here Im the guy who puts the stuff up on the sign about adversity and trials and things.", "I try to make it an encouragement to others, so they can apply it to their lives.", "Thats pretty important, because I think we all go through adversity, but its just for a season.", "Ive been really burdened by people with their fear.", "Its bad enough to have the condition, but to have the fear to go with it is even worse, he said.", "Hes been getting calls from all over the area, Alaska and even people in the Lower 48.", "Part of it is attributable to his recovery, he thinks, and part of it is probably because he is who he is a respected businessman, not the stereotypically (apologies again to Phoebe) leaves and twigs sort.", "After all, he is a long-serving member of the Central Peninsula Health Foundation board, which raises funds to support the hospital and its patients.", "Hes supported the addition of cancer treatment services at the hospital.", "And even though he chose to leave the country for his cancer treatment, he still is a staunch advocate for the local hospital.", "Without his doctors at Central Peninsula Hospital and in Anchorage, he wouldnt have gotten his diagnosis, and hes always felt well cared for in any medical needs hes had at home, he said.", "I look at the hospital and care thats here and its very good.", "Weve been here long enough to remember the old hospital, too, and its always been known as good, and you look at whats available now and theres a lot to be said about it.", "We should never take that for granted, he said.", "Its just unfortunate that what I received (in Mexico) is not available here.", "The (local) hospital is so supportive of wellness, it would be the first to look for ways to support wellness, and the peninsula should be thankful for that.", "But unfortunately, our U.S. society isnt allowing for some of the treatments that are done elsewhere in the world.", "As big of an advocate as hes become for his treatment, Abbott said he would in no way want to talk others into anything they arent comfortable with.", "All he can say is what worked for him.", "As far as Im concerned, just as long as theyre really strong in their decision, thats wonderful.", "Going to the hospital here and getting the treatment they need is wonderful, just as long as theyre strong in what theyre doing.", "I just want to help people, Abbott said.", "I have great respect for the work thats done at the hospital, but I know what worked on Rick Abbott prayer and this treatment in Mexico.", "Its very humbling to have gone to a place that has done all of this.", "Can I explain why it worked?", "No, I cant, its beyond me.", "All I can do is be thankful.", "He would be even more thankful to see those treatment options available in the U.S., especially right here at home.", "Im thinking thats changing, Phoebe said.", "Im hoping the effect of this sort of thing is evident and will be available someday.", "Notify me of new comments via email.", "Notify me of new posts via

This is, after all, the man behind the inspirational quotes posted on the sign in front of Spenard Builders Supply in Soldotna. This week\u2019s offering: \u201cOne thing you can\u2019t recycle is wasted time.\u201d</p>\n<p>As an optimist, he was hoping for a treatment plan to alleviate the neuropathy in his legs, pain in his joints, migraines, fatigue, nosebleeds and other health struggles that had been worsening. As a pragmatist, he was at least expecting an explanation of what was causing his symptoms.</p>\n<p>He got the latter, but in a form that would considerably test the former.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018You have lymphoma and leukemia.\u2019 The doctor said it just like that. No soft shoe,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I have talked to a doctor group in Seattle for over an hour about your case. I haven\u2019t been able to come up with a reason or a solution. I don\u2019t have a cure for you.\u2019 When you\u2019re given that prognosis, what do you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t panic, first of all. One doesn\u2019t maintain a successful business career as long as Abbott \u2014 40 years as general manager of Soldotna SBS and the old Superior Building Supply in Soldotna before that \u2014 by falling to pieces when faced with a difficult situation. You measure up the problem and use the best tools available to address it. In this case, as with all in Abbott\u2019s life, that meant relying on his love for family and his strength of faith.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a protective feeling of taking care of my wife (Phoebe), so I was trying to absorb what the doctor was saying, but more so I was trying to protect how she would receive this. But I know the Lord was protecting whatever feelings I was supposed to have. At that time I didn\u2019t have any fear or anxiety \u2014 I had none of those,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-11757\"></span></p>\n<p>What he did have was a spirit ingrained with hope, a mind open to the unconventional route along which that hope would lead him, a soul at peace with however that journey would turn out, and a wife who is every bit as strong in faith and resolve as he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up and don\u2019t take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. There\u2019s got to be something out there that can help,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>But there wasn\u2019t, at least not in the U.S. After being diagnosed by an oncologist in Alaska, Abbott was referred to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The news there, in January 2012, was just as grim.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him (the doctor), \u2018I\u2019ve worked in a lumber yards for many years, so I deal with charts and graphs. If you can take what I have inside me and put it on a chart or graph and show me where it is \u2014 is it on the left side of the graph, is it on the right, where is it? Is it going up? Is it going down?\u2019 I said, \u2018Wherever it is, it\u2019s OK with me, but if you could do that for me, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u2019\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>The doctor obliged, but the placement was not good, and the prognosis even worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey said it was terminal and that they couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>As long as Abbott could stand the symptoms, he could go about his life. As the disease progressed to its final stage, doctors could give him targeted chemotherapy to help with the pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018Will it kill the bad cells?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, it will.\u2019 I said, \u2018Will it kill the good cells?\u2019 He said, \u2018Unfortunately, it will.\u2019 I said, \u2018Will the bad cells come back?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said, \u2018What about the good cells?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, they won\u2019t.\u2019 He used the term \u2018shake and bake.\u2019 Me being a salesman I thought, \u2018He\u2019s got to come up with a different term,\u2019\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>Rather than taking that as gospel, the Abbotts decided to seek other wisdom. Phoebe was particularly interested in a hospital in Mexico, International Bio Care, which a longtime family friend, Annette Meyer, had told her about.</p>\n<p>To Abbott\u2019s ears it sounded a little strange. This is a guy, after all, who lives in work boots and flannel shirts. His office is decorated with old hand tools. He works in ledgers and budgets, with lumber and inventory \u2014 things that are reliably tangible, that can be measured, stacked and counted. He serves on the boards of the Kenai Peninsula Builders Association, Safari Club and Central Peninsula Hospital Foundation. And he\u2019s to traipse off to Tijuana to undergo a series of mystical-sounding treatments that are beyond the purview of U.S. medicine, outside the coverage of U.S. health insurance and pay for it out of pocket?</p>\n<p>\u201c(Meyer) told us about these treatments that were just neater than sliced bread. Phoebe said, \u2018We need to go to Mexico, we need to get all the facts that we possibly can.\u2019 And I\u2019m more basic, so I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>Phoebe, though, is more \u201cleaves and twigs,\u201d as the family lovingly, jokingly puts it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supportive of traditional medicine but I also know that preventative medicine is always a good thing. The kids used to pick on me because I was always into vitamins and things. The kids got tired of it as they got older, but now that they\u2019re grown up they\u2019ll ask their mom if I have any leaves and twigs for various things. I\u2019ve always tried to do things the healthy way,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>She called the hospital in Mexico and was immediately impressed. She had called after hours and there still was a doctor available to answer her questions. They offered to mail information to family members at no charge. They were helpful, courteous and friendly. And most of all, they offered hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cI called them and said he has this diagnosis and there wasn\u2019t much in the line of anything offered. Well, it was offered but there wasn\u2019t confidence that there would be any help. They would throw it at him and he would respond to it possibly, but he might not, so they\u2019d try it again, another round, and still again. But it would just come back,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I gave them the diagnosis and wondered if it was something they could treat. They said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>That single word was an answer to her prayers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey gave me hope. They said, \u2018Absolutely we have things to offer.\u2019 They said their success rate is high. And we, personally, have friends who have been there and highly recommended it. It was just a different approach. I was encouraged,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>People in the central Kenai Peninsula had undergone treatment at the facility and now were cancer free, she said. Not friends of friends, or a cousin\u2019s buddy, or a coworker\u2019s acquaintance\u2019s husband. People they actually knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe see the benefits done for people. We\u2019ve seen people where (U.S.) doctors had given up on them and now they\u2019re OK,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd you ask the doctors there (in Mexico) and the bottom line is, no, not everybody makes it, so it\u2019s not a magic place. And they would be very quick and clear to tell people that are there other hospitals than theirs that offer these treatments. But we heard of several people in this area who had received treatment there. And so we prayed about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>To sway Abbott even further was the sense he got that the hospital was truly out for his health, not his money.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey said to Phoebe, \u2018Have him come down here, we can help him.\u2019 She said their countenance was so different, so kind, and there are other people in this community who have already been there and are in remission. They did not say, \u2018What is his Social Security number, what\u2019s his credit card, how much money do you have, this is how much it is, blah, blah, blah.\u2019 As a businessman, that spoke volumes to me,\u2019\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, his cancer treatment was \u201ccheap\u201d \u2014\u00a0$27,000 for everything, including three weeks of in-patient care.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a bag of chemo (in the U.S.) costs, what, $6,000?\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>But treatment in the U.S. would be eligible for health insurance coverage, whereas everything with the Mexico treatment would be out of his own pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I went to my 401k,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at life or death, and you\u2019ve got three children, six grandchildren, a wife that you\u2019ve been married to for however long (43 years, he clarified \u2014\u00a0a fact that he does have readily available). To me it\u2019s a win-win deal, whether you live or die anyway. You\u2019ve got people that you love and love you, so what\u2019s a 401k for?\u201d</p>\n<p>They flew to San Diego in February 2012 and were met by a hospital representative who drove them across the border and to the 28-bed hospital. When they checked in they found fresh fruit and water waiting for both of them \u2014 a service that was refreshed daily throughout their stay. They figured it\u2019d be a day of waiting around and getting settled. And there was some getting settled \u2014\u00a0seeing the area around the hospital in Tijuana, which seemed quite safe, and meeting other patients, some from Mexico, others from Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere, including some Amish and Mennonite people, Abbott said. But there was no waiting around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe arrived on a Sunday. We figured, \u2018They\u2019ll get us checked in and nothing will happen until the next day.\u2019 Well, that wasn\u2019t true. They started immediate treatment. I was really pretty surprised at that, that they\u2019d do anything the first day,\u201d Phoebe said.</p>\n<p>Abbott underwent several procedures, including Alivizatos Treatment, named for the Greek doctor who pioneered the protocol. It\u2019s a 20-day infusion of vitamins, minerals and amino acids that is meant to regenerate and enhance the body\u2019s immune system and modulate its metabolism so that it essentially starves cancer cells and encourages the reproduction of healthy cells. He was put on the accompanying Alivizatos Greek Treatment Diet \u2014\u00a0low in acid and protein, encouraging drinking lots of alkaline water and avoiding preservatives, refined sugar, fat from meats, flour and alcohol \u2014 and began chelation for detoxification.</p>\n<p>He had hyperbaric oxygen therapy daily and underwent three rounds of hyperthermia treatment, where his body temperature was raised to 108 degrees to stimulate the body\u2019s response to fight off disease, as it would with a naturally occurring fever.</p>\n<p>When he first arrived at the hospital, Abbott\u2019s blood was drawn to create dendritic cell vaccines. The blood was sent off to Switzerland where it was treated, sent back to the hospital and sent home with Abbott to give himself two weeks of injections. The vaccines, as they\u2019re called, stimulate his dendritic cells, which circulate in the blood and can latch onto invading pathogens, again helping his body\u2019s immune response.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said going in, \u2018I want everything you can possibly give me, just pour it on,\u2019 and they did,\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p>He said he doesn\u2019t know all the science behind it, how it works or what it does, but he knows he felt an immediate improvement.</p>\n<p>They returned home to Sterling late in the week, and he returned to work the following Monday.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11737\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-before.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11737\" alt=\"Photos courtesy of Rick Abbott.

Things had changed. About two weeks after that I told my wife, \u2018Honey, I can feel my calf.\u2019 Now, this wasn\u2019t even supposed to be part of the deal, but I don\u2019t have neuropathy anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before being released, a doctor did a before-and-after review with Abbott, looking at his blood under a microscope. Upon arrival his red blood count was low, his white blood cells were inactive and a \u201ccitrus layer\u201d around his cells (an indicator of immune system health) was thin, he said. When he left his red blood cells were up, his white blood cells were active and the citrus layer had deepened.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so excited about that. In three week\u2019s time they had gotten the white cells to work. Just that, alone, in three week\u2019s time was amazing,\u201d Abbott said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-after.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11736\" alt=\"Abbott cells after\" src=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-after.jpg?w=300&#038;h=110\" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" srcset=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-after.jpg?w=300&amp;h=110 300w, https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-after.jpg?w=150&amp;h=55 150w, https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-cells-after.jpg 552w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Since then, though the doctors told him he\u2019d likely have to come back for further treatments, hid red blood count is still rising, he\u2019s feeling better all the time and \u2014\u00a0best yet \u2014 all of his blood tests have come back cancer free. He still hasn\u2019t needed another round of treatment.</p>\n<p>The entire experience was all-around amazing, Phoebe said, from the care to the treatment to the results. Particularly comforting to the Abbotts was the spiritual encouragement they found at the hospital. Abbott took a pillowcase that students from his church had made him, covered in handprints and Biblical verses. Throughout his stay he felt supported in his faith and was able to support other patients in theirs, he said.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11739\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-before.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11739\" alt=\"Above is Abbott's citrus layer before treatment.

I try to make it an encouragement to others, so they can apply it to their lives. That\u2019s pretty important, because I think we all go through adversity, but it\u2019s just for a season.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-after.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11738\" alt=\"Abbott citrus after\" src=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-after.jpg?w=300&#038;h=223\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-after.jpg?w=300&amp;h=223 300w, https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-after.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://redoubtreporter.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/abbott-citrus-after.jpg 552w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>If he can offer anything, he hopes it\u2019s at least a little comfort to help them through the dark, frightening experience of a cancer diagnosis.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been really burdened by people with their fear. It\u2019s bad enough to have the condition, but to have the fear to go with it is even worse,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been getting calls from all over the area, Alaska and even people in the Lower 48. Part of it is attributable to his recovery, he thinks, and part of it is probably because he is who he is \u2014\u00a0a respected businessman, not the stereotypically (apologies again to Phoebe) \u201cleaves and twigs\u201d sort.</p>\n<p>After all, he is a long-serving member of the Central Peninsula Health Foundation board, which raises funds to support the hospital and its patients. He\u2019s supported the addition of cancer treatment services at the hospital. And even though he chose to leave the country for his cancer treatment, he still is a staunch advocate for the local hospital. Without his doctors at Central Peninsula Hospital and in Anchorage, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten his diagnosis, and he\u2019s always felt well cared for in any medical needs he\u2019s had at home, he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look at the hospital and care that\u2019s here and it\u2019s very good. We\u2019ve been here long enough to remember the old hospital, too, and it\u2019s always been known as good, and you look at what\u2019s available now and there\u2019s a lot to be said about it. We should never take that for granted,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that what I received (in Mexico) is not available here. The (local) hospital is so supportive of wellness, it would be the first to look for ways to support wellness, and the peninsula should be thankful for that. But unfortunately, our U.S. society isn\u2019t allowing for some of the treatments that are done elsewhere in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>As big of an advocate as he\u2019s become for his treatment, Abbott said he would in no way want to talk others into anything they aren\u2019t comfortable with. All he can say is what worked for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, just as long as they\u2019re really strong in their decision, that\u2019s wonderful. Going to the hospital here and getting the treatment they need is wonderful, just as long as they\u2019re strong in what they\u2019re doing. I just want to help people,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cI have great respect for the work that\u2019s done at the hospital, but I know what worked on Rick Abbott \u2014 prayer and this treatment in Mexico. It\u2019s very humbling to have gone to a place that has done all of this. Can I explain why it worked? No, I can\u2019t, it\u2019s beyond me. All I can do is be thankful.\u201d</p>\n<p>He would be even more thankful to see those treatment options available in the U.S., especially right here at home.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that\u2019s changing,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the effect of this sort of thing is evident and will be available someday.\u201d</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpcnt\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wpa
