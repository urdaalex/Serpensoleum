Kangen ionized water, the enzyme count seemed to be dropping just as rapidly.", "While the patient today cannot be considered completely cured, he is in remission and both he and his family have high hopes of being entirely cancer free as the MRIs and tests continue.", "Kangen ionized water has a strength and power that supersedes conventional.", "When used in combination with traditional Western medication as we know it today, the results are shocking and often beyond belief.", "Ask yourself this question, can you really afford to not drink ionized water?", "Isnt your life worth trying to

While the ACS promotes medicinal treatments for cancer, the American Anti-Cancer Institute specializes more in the field of alternative medicines and methods to treat and prevent cancer without relying so heavily on drugs or medicines that are toxic to the body itself.</p>\n<p>Alkaline water is the #1 recommended tool by the AACI in preventing cancer, helping the body to remain in remission, if not a cured state, and to help ensure that cancer cannot sneak its way back.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://completehealthsolution.com\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-132 aligncenter\" alt=\"cancer_news\" src=\"https://dangerouswater.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cancer_news.jpg?w=510&#038;h=401\" width=\"510\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://dangerouswater.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cancer_news.jpg?w=510&amp;h=401 510w, https://dangerouswater.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cancer_news.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://dangerouswater.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cancer_news.jpg?w=300&amp;h=236 300w, https://dangerouswater.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cancer_news.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Read the quotes below from published and successful doctors, primarily oncologists.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026When cancer patients come into my office \u2026 their bodies are almost always very acidic and toxic.

When our blood is not sufficiently supplied with the vitamins and minerals it needs to properly keep our bodies performing, it begins to leech what it needs from bones, muscle tissue and ligaments. Obviously, this takes a huge toll on our bodies; often we have no idea how our bodies are struggling until it is too late.</p>\n<p>Certain blood disorders, types of leukemia, and cancers are attributed to an over production of white blood cells. The typical number of white blood cells is between 0-10,000. One Kangen user was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphotic Lukemia after his white blood cell counts tested between 12,000-15,000 for several months. This patient happened to be the former president of the Porter Hospital and was a huge believer in Western medicine. At the persistent urging of his wife and daughter, he purchased an Enagic machine and began faithfully drinking his daily fluid intake in the form of Kangen water. Within two months, his white blood cell count was reduced to 5,500. Since 2011, his white blood cell count has never jumped over 6,000. He recently celebrated his 80th birthday and 60th wedding anniversary.</p>\n<p>While Kangen water does not claim to cure cancer, we rejoice in the victories we hear and encourage everyone to experience the benefits that Kangen water can heap on the body. Another Kangen user wanted to share her personal testimony when it came to her experiences with Hepatitis C:</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, my name is Melissa and I have a personal testimony about Kangen Water. In late March of 2009 I was rushed to the hospital with little hope of living thru my stay there. I had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C in June of 2006. I didn&#8217;t realize the monster I had living in my body, in my blood. At least not until then, 2009. The Hepatitis C had been devouring my liver. When I arrived at the hospital, I could no longer walk. The doctor&#8217;s told my husband to call my family, my time was expiring quickly. I also was battling a terrible case of Pneumonia. The acidosis had built up thru out my body. My stomach was so large, it looked as though I was 10 months pregnant and my feet looked like a large elephant&#8217;s foot. I wasn&#8217;t allowed to eat and my water intake was cautiously monitored. A few tiny sips every 4 hours. I was a miserable mess. By the grace of God, a month later, I was transferred by ambulance to a Rehabilitation Hospital to learn to walk, while of course taking all kinds of medication to stabilize my liver and a strict low protein diet. I would make every excuse not to go to my therapy classes because my pain was over whelming. Finally after 6 weeks, starting with a wheelchair and then graduating to a walker, I was released to start my new sickly life at home. I was put on the waiting list for a liver transplant on December 29, 2009. I remember the date, it was the first time I was excited and relieved. But, would I get a liver before my new expiration date would come which was now 2 years? In the meantime, my Dad, would tell me about this great water that I needed to drink. He explained to me how it was a miracle/healing water and so forth. My Dad was living in Comanche, Oklahoma at the time and he asked me if I would be willing to try the Kangen Water.(which means back to Orgin in Japanese) I said of course! He introduced me to Mark Robertson here in Denver, Colorado, who works with Kangen Water getting water units to people. And my healing started. Mark would bring me water each week and I drank it faithfully. The great refreshing taste, my powerful mind set to be healed, the belief I have in my Lord Jesus and in The Kangen Water, and the inspiration I received from my new friend Mark Robertson, my blood test results started to improve, I began to walk with a cane and had energy enough to carry me thru the day. It has been 2 years since I have been drinking Kangen Water. My testimony to everyone is to share with you, where I currently stand health wise. I am now stable. My liver has remained stable for 9 months and The Hepatitis C lays dormant now for 10 months. I owe this great victory to My Lord Jesus and The Kangen Water. And of course my Dad and to Mark Robertson who has dedicated his life to helping people thru sharing this water, and is available to make sure you are able to have it in your life. Whether your healthy, ill, frustrated or fill weak and empty, please get it touch with Kangen Water. It will change your life!</p>\n<p>Sincerely yours,</p>\n<p>Melissa Jones Giddings\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, Kangen does not make any claims that it can cure these diseases. We like to let those who have had experience share it and pass hope along to others who may be struggling. After all, it was the<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fi-magicwater23-2009feb23,0,4203536.story?track=rss\"> Los Angeles Times</a> that called Kangen water a \u201cmiracle elixir\u201d, not us!

We\u2019ve heard stories of improvement in so many different aspects of health, well-being, and wellness that it often times seems impossible to recount them all. The following testimony, however, is one that you cannot miss reading; it may be the story that saves your life.</p>\n<p>In early 2009, a physician in Quebec purchased an Enagic machine for himself and offered the water to several of his patients. One patient\u2019s relative was so impressed that he purchased a machine for his own personal use. This patient had been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and the doctors had deemed his case hopeless. He had begun receiving palliative care and making preparations for the end.</p>\n<p>After two months of faithfully drinking the ionized water, along with taking the medications from his doctors, the patient began feeling better than he had. In fact, he even went on vacation with his family for the first time in several years.</p>\n<p>From the time the patient was diagnosed with liver cancer, his enzyme count had been rapidly increasing as the cancer progressed. Since the patient began drinking Kangen ionized water, the enzyme count seemed to be dropping just as rapidly.</p>\n<p>While the patient today cannot be considered completely \u201ccured\u201d, he is in remission and both he and his family have high hopes of being entirely cancer free as the MRIs and tests continue.</p>\n<p>Kangen ionized water has a strength and power that supersedes conventional. When used in combination with traditional Western medication as we know it today, the results are shocking and often beyond belief.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself this question, can you really afford to not drink ionized water? Isn\u2019t your life worth trying to protect and preserve?</p>\n<p>As always, feel free to investigate yourself at <a
