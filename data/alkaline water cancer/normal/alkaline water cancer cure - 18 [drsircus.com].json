alt=\"Dr. Mark Pagel, baking soda and cancer researcher.\"></p>\n<p>University of Arizona Cancer  Center member Dr. Mark Pagel will receive a $2 million grant from the National  Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of personalized <a href=\"http://azcc.arizona.edu/node/4187\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">baking soda cancer treatment for breast cancer</a>. In other words,  clinical trials on the use of oral <a href=\"http://drsircus.com/medicine/sodium-bicarbonate-baking-soda\">baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)</a> for breast cancer  treatments are about to start!<a href=\"#_edn1\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref1\">[1]</a> Obviously there are people  in the know who have understood that sodium bicarbonate, that  same stuff that can save a person&#8217;s life in the emergency room in a heartbeat,  is a primary cancer treatment option of the safest and most effective kind.</p>\n<p>Of course I feel vindicated for  everything I wrote in <a href=\"http://drsircus.com/books/e-book/sodium-bicarbonate-second-edition\">Sodium Bicarbonate \u2013 Rich Man&#8217;s Poor Man&#8217;s Cancer Treatment</a>, which still stands  as the only full medical review on the subject of using simple baking soda in  the practice of medicine. When taken orally with water, especially water with  high magnesium content, and when used transdermally in medicinal baths, sodium  bicarbonate becomes a first-line medicinal for the treatment of cancer, kidney  disease, diabetes, influenza and even the common cold. It is  also a powerful buffer against radiation exposure, so everyone should be up to  speed on its use. Everybody&#8217;s physiology is under heavy nuclear attack from  strong radioactive winds that are circling the northern hemisphere.</p>\n<p>Actually  it is no surprise that a University of Arizona researcher received this grant  because there has been cancer research going on for years there. Dr. Robert J.  Gillies and his colleagues have already demonstrated that pre-treatment of mice  with <strong>baking soda results in the  alkalinization of the area around tumors</strong>. The same researchers reported that <strong>bicarbonate increases tumor pH and also inhibits spontaneous metastases  in mice with breast cancer</strong>.<a href=\"#_edn2\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref2\">[2]</a> It also reduces the rate of lymph node  involvement.</p>\n<p>I  recently published about fungal infections, and breast cancer has been found to  be associated with increased frequency of mold-fermented cheese consumption.<a href=\"#_edn3\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref3\">[3]</a> Fungi produce toxic metabolites  called mycotoxins<a href=\"#_edn4\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref4\">[4]</a> that can cause cancer. Aflatoxin is a mycotoxin with carcinogenic potency that is found in inferior  peanut butter and other nut and dairy products. Researchers in 1993 examined  human breast cancer tissue and found significant carcinogenic aflatoxin within  the cancer tissue <strong>implicating  aflatoxin and thus fungus as a cause of breast cancer</strong>.<a href=\"#_edn5\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref5\">[5]</a></p>\n<p class=\"quotes\"><em>The pH level of our internal fluids affects every cell in our body. Chronic over-acidity corrodes body tissue, and if left unchecked  will interrupt all cellular activities and functions. In other words,  over-acidity interferes with life itself. </em><strong><em>It is at the root of cancer</em></strong><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Sodium  bicarbonate medical treatments are the time honored method to &#8220;speed up&#8221; the  return of the body&#8217;s bicarbonate levels to normal. Sodium bicarbonate happens  to be one of our most useful medicines as it treats the basic acid-alkaline  axis of human physiology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"alignCenter\">Baking Soda and PH Medicine</h2>\n<p>The pH of our tissues and body  fluids is crucial and central because it affects and mirrors the state of our  health or our inner cleanliness. The  closer the pH is to 7.35-7.45, the higher our level of health and wellbeing.  Staying within this range dramatically increases our ability to resist acute  illnesses like colds and flues as well as the onset of cancer and other  diseases. Keeping our pH within a healthy range also involves necessary  lifestyle and dietary changes that will protect us over the long term while the  use of sodium bicarbonate gives us a jump-start toward increased alkalinity.</p>\n<p>The  pH scale is like a thermometer showing increases and decreases in the acid and  alkaline content of fluids. Deviations <strong>above or below</strong> a 7.35-7.45 pH range in the tightly  controlled blood can signal potentially serious and dangerous symptoms or  states of disease. When the body can no longer effectively neutralize and  eliminate the acids, it relocates them within the body&#8217;s extra-cellular fluids  and connective tissue cells directly compromising cellular integrity.  Conversely when the body becomes too alkaline from too much bicarbonate in the  blood, metabolic alkalosis occurs, which can lead to severe consequences if not  corrected quickly.<a href=\"#_edn6\" class=\"miniRef\" id=\"_ednref6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jonbarron.org/natural-health/nl101004/newsletter-mercola-alkaline-water-ph.php\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Barron</a> presents a way of looking at pH that opens  up one of the major benefits of alkaline water:</p>\n<p class=\"leftCitation\">Hydrogen ions tie up oxygen. That means  that the more acid a liquid is, the less available the oxygen in it. Every cell  in our body requires oxygen for life and to maintain optimum health. Combine  that with what we know about hydrogen ions and we see that the more acid the  blood (the lower its pH), the less oxygen is available for use by the cells.  Without going into a discussion of the chemistry involved, just understand that  it&#8217;s the same mechanism involved when acid rain &#8220;kills&#8221; a lake. The fish  literally suffocate to death because the acid in the lake &#8220;binds up&#8221; all of the  available oxygen. It&#8217;s not that the oxygen has gone anywhere; it&#8217;s just no  longer available. Conversely, if you raise the pH of the lake (make it more  alkaline), oxygen is now available and the lake comes back to life.  Incidentally, it&#8217;s worth noting that cancer is related to an acid environment  (lack of oxygen)\u2014the higher the pH (the more oxygen present in the cells of the  body), the harder it is for cancer to thrive.</p>\n<p class=\"leftCitation\">Understanding  this is important for two reasons: (1) it reveals one of the primary benefits  of alkaline water\u2014more &#8220;available&#8221; oxygen in the system and (2) it explains why  alkaline water helps fight cancer.</p>\n<p class=\"quotes\"><em>The ocean, the mother of all life, has an  average pH of about 8.1.  The ideal pH for blood sits at about 7.4, slightly alkaline\u2014not acidic. <span class=\"esp\">&#8211; Jon Barron</span></em></p>\n<p>Barron concludes:</p>\n<p class=\"leftCitation\">If you&#8217;re eating well and living cleanly, then yes,  you want to drink water with a naturally occurring pH only slightly above  neutral. However, if you are eating the typical Western diet, high in meat,  grains, sodas, and sugars that acidify the body, then you have a different  problem. Your pH balance is now so far out of normal that you must go beyond  normal in the other direction to counter it. My recommendation for daily  drinking water pH is about 7.5-8\u2014depending on how acid forming your diet is.  Long-term consumption of higher pH water should be reserved for special  circumstances. The most famous mountain waters in the world, waters renowned  for their healing properties, are highly alkaline. I&#8217;m referring to the waters  coming down from the Himalayas, and specifically to the waters of the Hunza Valley,  which have a  pH that runs between 9 and 11.</p>\n<p>One does not have to be a doctor to  practice <strong>pH medicine</strong>. Every practitioner of the healing arts and every  mother and father needs to understand how to use sodium bicarbonate.  Bicarbonate deficiency is a real problem that deepens with age so it really  does pay to understand and appreciate what baking soda is all about.</p>\n<div class=\"reference\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" id=\"_edn1\">[1]</a> Baking Soda  Might Have Potential Against Cancer: <a href=\"http://digitaljournal.com/article/323645\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">http://digitaljournal.com/article/323645</a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" id=\"_edn2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19276390\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19276390</a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"edn3\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref3\" id=\"_edn3\">[3]</a> One sample study is by Le, et al.

Calcium oxalate crystals are  formed when calcium binds with oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is a mycotoxin that can  be produced by a number of different fungal species. Some fungi produce such  large amounts of oxalic acid that they are used for commercial production of  chemicals.

She has been complaining of shoulder and hip pain.  Blood work showed on Sept. 22, 2016 her CA (Cancer Antigen) 15-3 marker to be at 691.2!  (Normal range should be 1.0 &#8211; 30.0).   Doctors use this test to monitor a person&#8217;s response to breast cancer treatment.  Doctor said the number was off the chart and that the cancer has spread into bones, lungs and spleen.  He indicated she could not do radiation or Chemo but instead offered medication for  pain. (basically go home and die)  He did however want a biopsy of the hip to see if it was the breast cancer recurrence.  We changed doctors but had the hip biopsy done (it was breast cancer).  Upon leaving the doctor&#8217;s office I put mom on baking soda to raise her ph to become alkaline and she kept her ph at 7.5 &#8211; 8.5 checking it every morning still as I write this.  We also started juicing with Dr. Gerson&#8217;s green Juice therapy recipe to help rebuild her bones.  Mom follows the baking soda and Gerson juicing religiously.  We asked for another workup of the CA 15 &#8211; 3 marker test  which was done on Oct 5th prior to meeting the new Doctor.  We met with the doctor and he wanted to start her on meds.  Problem was the meds were $10,032 for 21 pills and her part would still be $2,856 per month.  She took one pill and felt terrible.  Prior to this medication she had felt better than she had in quite a while.  We also got the results of the new blood work after our doctors appointment and from Sept 22th till our Oct 5th re-test of the CA 15 &#8211; 3 (which was approx. 12 days) the test showed a count of 423.7. (267.5 pt drop). Since mom felt bad from the medication and her CA 15 &#8211; 3 test was dropping without meds I asked if she would try another 2 weeks without meds, which she agreed.  Our follow up appt was Oct 19th and again we requested the CA 15 &#8211; 3 before our meeting.  This time we had the results of our Oct 17th CA 15 &#8211; 3 test and the results were now 298.4 (another drop of 125.3) We had our 2nd visit with the doctor and he was taken back that she had not been taking her medicine but was impressed with how well she felt and the fact that her CA 15 &#8211; 3 had dropped 392.8 pts from Sept 22 to Oct 17th.  I told him we would like to continue our natural cure but asked for his help in the monitoring.  He agreed, but asked what we were doing?  He had never heard of what we were doing, but said it seems to be working and agreed to use continuing.  I told mom at the rate the CA count is dropping we should be below 30 in a couple of more weeks.  We have a follow up visit on Nov 16th and getting blood work done on the 14th.  If everything continues as we are, I truly hope the cancer will be gone in  53 days!  Also, mom no longer has shoulder or hip pain.  Our fingers are crossed and not bad considering the first doctor said &#8220;nothing we can do for you but give you pain pills&#8221;.  If her Nov 14th CA results come back below 30 or even close we have beat Cancer in less than 2 months!</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-63166\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-63166\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-63166\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-63166\">Frank</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-63166\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-63166\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I work in medicine and would like to know what is the optimal PH you would like to blood to be to treat CA.

The cancer was gone in 3 months! PSA of 87/95 what&#8217;s the difference! As a retired<br />\nlab guy, the higher the numbers the more fluctuation is expected in the results&#8230;don&#8217;t check it every 2 wks, check it every 2 months. Always remember you didn&#8217;t get sick in 1 day! This is a slow process, esp. involving the prostate. The faster the cancer grows, the more acidic your body is. It&#8217;s like feeding a plant the proper nutrients (fertilizer), the faster the growth (cancer). So the question is&#8230; is it the type of  cancer responsible for the fast growth or is it the body (environment) which it feeds upon? I suggest get into juicing, light exercising if possible and RELAX!!!  Just recently I bought an alkaline ionizer machine by Bawell 2195 model; might want to check that out. There are articles by a Italian oncologist Dr. Tullio Simoncini that might interest you. If Christian, remember God is in control!!!!!!!! Don&#8217;t give up HOPE my friend(s) also here at the MB, because hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.

If you keep the magnesium and potassium and selenium and zinc up along with a good multi mineral pill dose everyday the sodium will be in line and not as big a worry as some say for blood pressure. In fact magnesium and potassium and other minerals can keep migraines away and keep blood pressure in line..

But one thing you can look into that is way better treatment than chemo is Ozone Therapy. The specific treatment or delivery system  that infuses oxygen in cells is called &#8220;Rectal Insufflation&#8221;. Like chemo it is an oxidizing treatment but it is selective with no side effects and does not poison the body. It only kills cancer cells and helps other cells get better through oxygen. The technology behind this is well researched and has been around for decades. The leading researcher in this field is Dr. Robert Rowan (in the USA)&#8230; he practices in California and has a you tube channel that allows you to see results of his treatments. Call his office and get some advice on this approach. </p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robert G. Wright in his book &#8220;Kill Cancer not Patients&#8221; he indicates that If you have undergone chemo, radiation and surgery (the big 3), then you need to take added measures to remove the remaining toxins in the body. Statics show  that most chemo patients (about 97%) are hit with cancer more aggressively the second time around due to damage caused in the body by radiation and chemo. The effects occurs within 5 years of the treatment. That is because the cancer along with the insidious side effects of the toxins from chemo and radiation is still present in the body.

ALA in the correct dosages has the ability to turn off bad genes or stop them from expressing themselves. ALA, also protects the body from some of the harmful affects of radiation.  ALA heps with the break down of sugar for the production of ATP the fuel produced by the cells to run the body, without adequate  ALA cells cannot utilize energy and will eventually shut down. It Is also a potent detoxer of heavy metals and  other poisons within the body, Burt Berkson  author  of  &#8220;The Alpha  Lipoic Acid Breakthrough &#8221; describes how he cured patients of deadly mushroom poisoning using ALA.

Selenium is also powerful against cancer, it increases the level of glutathione in the body, which increases the power of and influences the development  of the bodys own cancer fighting cells&#8230;.

Obviously. I&#8217;d say its best to stick with fruits and vegetables. Many lists online.</p>\n<p>2) it would be advised to keep the sugar very low, but sugar supplies other (good) functions in the body. I can&#8217;t recall off the top of my head, but I think it&#8217;s only fructose that supplies energy to brain cells.</p>\n<p>3) look into the vitamin B17. Basically it apricot seeds. I&#8217;ve read a lot of info about people curing their cancer with this and there are natives in some country (hunzas, I think) that eat apricots and the seeds and are said to never get cancer&#8230;add live sunstantially long lives. I suppose the b17 is ingested by the cancer cells because it&#8217;s bound to glucose (or something like that), then the b17 kills the cell. So eat up. There&#8217;s much information that claims taking b17 is toxic, but I assure you, I&#8217;ve eaten many apricot seeds before, and &#8230;well&#8230;I&#8217;m sitting here typing.</p>\n<p>4) I think the sodium bicarbonate would be very beneficial (of course on a limited time frame), but there are also many other alkalizing methods such as alkaline drops, that wouldn&#8217;t give you too high of a sodium intake (if that&#8217;s at all a concern). I would suggest lower the ph by decreasing the amount of NaHCO3 after a week so it&#8217;s still alkaline but not as much.</p>\n<p>5) I&#8217;ve read also a lot of good info wit essiac tea.</p>\n<p>I think the true cure lies in the b17, in the apricot kernels. They can taste bitter, but who cares? Right? I&#8217;ve read many testimonials about b17 and I think it is scientifically proven to kills the cancer cells. I think there&#8217;s some misguided information being spread about b17 being too toxic for humans to ingest, but I believe (as many others) that b17 is only toxic to cancer cells. </p>\n<p>Well, I hope I helped and I hope people the best.</p>\n<p>Remember don&#8217;t be too alkaline and cause alkalosis. And you probably want to eat about at least a handful of apricot kernels a day, spread out throughout the day. </p>\n<p>God bless.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-15141\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-15141\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-15141\">\n                <a id=\"dsq-author-user-15141\" href=\"http://churchofsmoke.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jose</a>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-15141\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-15141\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>$2 million is enough to have the results sabotaged.

Please check your pH every day  and deal with the root cause of your digestive problems and use the bicarbonate to jump start getting more alkaline in general.   Chcek pH daily and keep ph around 7.3.<br />\nAdjust the amount you are using according to  average pH readings over a few days time and don&#8217;t judge by one reading alone.  pH levels can change rapidly from moment to moment and can even be affected by emotions, simple thoughts of food, sights, smells etc so  do daily or twice daily pH testing of your urine or saliva and note the average over a few days time.<br />\nStudy the chapter in the bicarbonate ebook on cautions and contraindications  for sodium bicarbonate use.    If pH consistently stays too low&#8230;.under 6.5 or over 7.5 change what you are doing in terms of dosage or dietary actions.   Nutrients including minerals are not properly absorbed or utilized if pH gets under about 5.5.   You will have to feel your way around in terms of how much to add or decrease of the sodium bicarbonate to make a change and please allow a few days for the body to adjust.<br />\nMake sure you are also making dietary and lifestyle changes so the need for long term bicarbonate use is decreased.<br />\nDrinking magnesium bicarbonate water will be effective for long term use  and can be used as your regular drinking water.

I have recently taken him to a homeopathic Doc which the others doctors frown on and he does cranial therapy 3 times a week and I have started him on juice plus for his nutrition and probiotics and I did talk to the doc about the PH thing but he is trying to research and see if we can do that with CJ cause he wants to be safe..And how do you check the PH level?

The colon may be unique to treating cancers elsewhere in the body.  The GI tract is actually outside your body in a way and the colon needs an optimal microbiota with good bacteria to support health.   An acidic environment is created in the colon with a diet high in fiber and resistant starch.  This is good because the probiotics feed and ferment this prebiotic food, producing short &#8211; chain fatty acids that nourish the gut and can actually positively change gene expression.  Directly putting baking soda in the colon with an enema will raise the pH and create an environment for pathogenic bacteria. </p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-15066\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-15066\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-15066\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-15066\">Cathning</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-15066\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-15066\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Hi Dan P, I am researching the viability of a Sodium Bicarbonate Enema for my friend&#8217;s colon cancer and we have the litmus ph strips to hand to avoid over alkalising- do you think the enema is worth a shot- this is a question for dr sircus also.

My point was,  you want to feed the probiotics in your colon with fermentable fibers and resistant starch (which are all considered prebiotics).  This is good and actually makes an acidic environment when short chain fatty acids are produced.  Most bad bacteria in colon thrive in an alkaline environment and good bacteria in acidic.  A zero fiber diet will make colon alkaline  and favors bad bacteria.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-12692\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-12692\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-12692\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-12692\">Brad</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-12692\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-12692\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>In cancer studies with mice, a 200 mM sodium bicarbonate/water solution seems to be an effective standard dose.

For example any doctor would want to know if this is an average reading over a period of time, or intermittent&#8230;..how often he tests pH etc. and whether he is doing something to deliberately bring this on.   You would need a consult with Dr. Sircus  or another doctor to discuss this further. But yes, it is a cause for concern.    Normally pH should remain ideally around 7.3    or at 8 if using sodium bicarbonate for cancer treatment, for a couple of weeks at  a time, but generally not as high as 11.<br />\nClaudia French<br />\nIMVA</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-12609\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-12609\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-12609\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-12609\">John Turner</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-12609\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-12609\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>We may need to read between the lines.

Namely, in the mornings, he has to do testosterone cream, supplements, his baking soda drink, and thyroid meds (natural desiccated thyroid). </p>\n<p>The problem is that the baking soda will neutralize his stomach acid to some degree, which means he won&#8217;t take in nutrients well from his supplements and foods if they are mixed in his stomach. He also has to keep his thyroid meds away from calcium-containing food as well as iron. So here is our plan:</p>\n<p>1) Upon waking, do testosterone cream plus baking soda drink</p>\n<p>2)  An hour later, eat and take supplements, and just in case stomach acid is still too alkaline to absorb nutrients, drink down supplements and eat food with Apple Cider Vinegar or lemon in water.</p>\n<p>3)  An hour later, take thyroid meds with an acid in the drink.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the best we can think of.

Its best to take the sodium bicarbonate on an empty stomach &#8230;..about 2 hours before or after  any food or supplements if you can stretch it this far, perhaps bedtime ?     Also if he is taking any iodine supplementation, that also needs to be taken apart from any other supplements that might interfere especially Vit. C or other antioxidants.  It is  best to take iodine supplements on an empty stomach and at least an hour or two apart from other supplements so early am would work or if using it twice a day you can do another dose in mid afternoon so it won&#8217;t interfere with sleep.<br />\nClaudia French<br />\nIMVA</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-12317\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-12317\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-12317\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-12317\">Amanda</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-12317\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-12317\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I have a condition called pvns.  benign tumors grow in my knee and behind it.

I have gone through most of the traditional, recommended treatments: left side rad mastectomy with lymph node removal (2cm tumor, 1 node with 2mm extranodal extension).  I also opted for a prophylactic right side mastectomy.  I had 15 rounds of chemo and opted out of the 16th and final round.  I also opted out of the recommended radiation treatment.  The cancer was PR/ER+ and they have now started giving me shots to shut down my ovaries.  I have been taking an AI, Arimidex, but have recently stopped taking it due to the SE of the meds.  I am cancer free at this point and plan to stay that way.  I don&#8217;t understand the overtreatment of cancer patients with drugs that actually take away from their quality of life.  Is all this medication really necessary?  It makes more sense to me, now that the cancer is gone, to just make sure I stay on the alkaline side to keep myself healthy.  Does this seem reasonable?</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-11765\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-11765\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-11765\">\n                <a id=\"dsq-author-user-11765\" href=\"http://drsircus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claudia French</a>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-11765\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-11765\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Dear Joie,</p>\n<p>So sorry to hear about your tremendous problems.   Yes, it will be to your benefit to stay more alkaline but you also need to keep an adequate store of nutrients.   This will be crucal to fending off any further cancers.   You should get Dr. Sircus&#8217; book on Treatment Essentials which will list the protocol items that Dr. Sircus feels all should follow to the extent they can to boost immune systems.

So I tried to think of ways to make it more palatable and I think Ive found the answer. Its so simple. I just add a small amount of citric acid. The bicarb will fizz &#8211; sorry pHizz &#8211; due to the reaction between citric acid and some of the bicarb to form sodium citrate and carbon dioxide (the pHizz). The resulting drink is delicious! The really neat thing is the sodium citrate is metabolized back into sodium bicarbonate again in the body (see <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/ppa/sodium-citrate-citric-acid.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.drugs.com/ppa/sodium-citrate-citric-acid.html</a>), Thus the entire drink becomes a systemic alkalizer!

Start out with a small dose and check your pH.  Do not exceed the limits of only taking 3 half teaspoons per day if you are over age 60.

Then 1 on the inside under his jaw bone. The one on the inside grows very rapidly and is now blocking the throat and comming through the nostrils.  Then are going to giving him a trake ( do not ask me why they have not already) They are administing larges amount of cemo into him and it is something they worry may do more damage than good.  Still they feel he has nothing to lose.  I was wondering if putting the baking soda and water together to make a paste to place on the tumors would be recommended since this cancer is growing so fast.  He will not die from the cancer tumors itself more likely from suffication.  I was also wondering if my family who have not been dignosed (praise God) should also try taking baking soda with water once in a while to prevent anything from occurring would hurt?

(See other articles on bicarb by Dr Sircus on this same website) Apparently Dr. Simoncini believes the oral method only works when the tumors are in the digestive areas and the bicarb can make direct contact with them. Dr. Sicrus disagrees and believes if taken orally it still gets into the bloodstream and increases the PH of tumors anywhere in the body, although I think he may have written that oral works even better with tumours that are between the mouth and the anus. I personally think it&#8217;s less risky taking it orally and just as effective in many cases.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-9483\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-9483\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-9483\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-9483\">Aiko</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-9483\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-9483\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>anti_banker, than you for your reply.

The 19th I went to 3 teaspoons a day<br />\nSept 21 st , I hit 8.5 I have held that through today Oct 1st.<br />\nWent to my oncolagist today,told him what I was doing he pooh poohed me .said if it worked they would be using it etc .told me I should start chemo &amp; radiation because fooling with the baking soda regament is false hope . How long should I hold the 8.5 PH  number? How will I know I have killed the cancer? since I have started I have had no night sweats (I had them every night prior for several months)  The oncolagist told me my insurance would not cover a pet scan to check if the cancer was dead if he told them I Tried this baking soda procedure on my own.<br />\nSO how long do I hold the 8.5 PH ?, how do I know if the cancer has all died ?<br />\nI will say I am very P.Oed at the Cancer Drs in my area.

And when you pause for breaks in between weeks, how long do you rest for? Should she be doing this for a week, and then stop for a week, and then start again the same way? Please let me know! Thank you!</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-4\" id=\"dsq-comment-33816\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-33816\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-33816\">\n                <a id=\"dsq-author-user-33816\" href=\"http://drsircus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claudia French</a>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-33816\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-33816\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Dear Cocoa,</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8599\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8599\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8599\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8599\">Yo Tom!</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8599\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8599\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Hi Tom, you need to find a sympathetic doctor who will help you. When it comes to cancer it is best to deal with it as quickly as possible and to take it very seriously before it spreads too much. I strongly suggest that you continue your baking soda treatment but also find a way to get medically observed somewhere, and most importantly to not waste even a second of time but start the full treatment to get rid of cancer. I took the full normal treatment and they pump lots of fear into people about the treatment, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as bad as people made it out to be. I took chemotherapy, and it really worked wonderfully and I&#8217;m glad they even have such a medicine. The reason the hair eventually falls out temporarily is because it is a fast growing cell and chemo targets mainly fast growing cells. So please do not risk your life over any of this, you must get observed and tested and not waste any time getting fully treated when it comes to cancer. This is my sincere advice coming from direct experience. I wasted two years not getting treated and the cancer spread during that time until I had to go to the hospital for breathing issues and coughing, I was pretty pissed about wasting the time and not getting treated due to fear, especially when I found out despite the morbid pleasure doctors take in scaring people about everything, the chemo didn&#8217;t do anything bad like they claim and I got better and felt better really quickly. Another good thing to stimulate your immunity is to go into a kind of rage mode of getting pumped up and feel the energy pumping through you and strength and that can help boost the immunity and stuff. Please get observed and treated immediately with sympathetic doctors where you can find them and don&#8217;t waste any time risking it with cancer.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-12745\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-12745\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-12745\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-12745\">dennis3</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-12745\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-12745\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I hope you are all better and that you are cancer free.</p>\n<p>Question: What did you do to stop, minimize or other treat your cancer during your two years before the chemo?</p>\n<p>If you did nothing but sit for 2 years then you missed the whole point and are lucky to be alive today.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-14402\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-14402\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-14402\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-14402\">Genavie Mccrea</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-14402\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-14402\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>That is terrible advice! If chemo worked for you then your one of the lucky 2 percent it works for. Chemo has a two percent success rate and I would wager that its been within 5 years that you had chemo because it only suppresses cancer for around a five year period and then it comes back mutated and with a vengeance. There are over 50 alternative cancer treatments that have a great success rate. Turpentine and kerosene both cure cancer and late stage cancer for example and multiple alternative cancer treatments can be utilized at the same time for under $100. You are spreading fear and misinformation and for you to even be on this site reading and replying shows you are still concerned with cancer and not as sure of your life saving chemo as you say. Could be a doctor or big pharma employee as well! I wish you well and hope you find truth and love in everything.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-4\" id=\"dsq-comment-14953\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-14953\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-14953\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-14953\">Ivona Goe Holm</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-14953\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-14953\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I have survived cancer 4 times so far and after 10 years it is back again. SO I am on number 5 now.  Chemo killed my mom, my sister, my Aunt and my grand mom.  I did not do chemo with the breast cancers and melanoma, just surgery.  I am dealing with  B cell cancer now and no insurance for doctors and doctors will do nothing for you if you cannot pay them.  It is all about money.  Any way I have a large tumor in my neck now and it is starting to cause issue and of course with any blood cancer you are sick a lot!   Fluish almost.  I am seeking alternative.  I did do chemo the first time I had blood cancer but it had me in the hospital so many times then it almost killed me,  plus it did so much permanent neuro damage that I will die before I try that route again.  I am going to try the baking soda and maple syrup. Any suggestions on anything else that has worked on another?</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5\" id=\"dsq-comment-15151\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-15151\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-15151\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-15151\">bugswest</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-15151\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-15151\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Cancer is closely associated to fungus, especially Candida albicans, which thrive in a high glucose environment, chiefly an anaerobic verses aerobic cell function. Treat cancer as a mold which means light, alkaline environment, reduced glucose will slow and kill it.  Anaerobic cells consume 15x more glucose than aerobic cells, that is how they target cancer cells with chemotherapy, anaerobic cells have approximately 5 chemical reactions prior to energy release whereas the aerobic cell has approximately 10+. In a nutshell alkaline diet will help more than anything, no dairy, meat, sugar in any form, i.e. soda, flour, bread, pasta, these are high in acid or acid forming, alkaline foods are most vegetables, yogurt, Brazil nuts, honey to name a few. Look up an acid / alkaline food chart for more detail, the mix is 80/20 for good health, good researching, knowledge of nutrition is your MD, look at a slow speed juicer and the results of apple/carrot combinations.

B17 is in many seeds and other food, Also B17 on its own is not reported to do well if you have had operations for cancer but seems to work if you have not. Keep to the B17&#8230;check it out on the internet and see what else it is in&#8230; and go strict on the cancer diet which is a alkaline diet. If your body is not acid&#8230; check this out also re alkaline balance for your body&#8230;. the cancer has a hard job to survive, this is a VERY important piece of information. So, check out Alkaline diets and live on it.. get litmus papers so you can check your body alkaline/ acid balance regularly.  good luck. liz &#8230;</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-5\" id=\"dsq-comment-16264\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-16264\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-16264\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-16264\">Mark Wilding</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-16264\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-16264\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Apart from diet changes, Apricot kernels need to be taken with proteolytic enzymes (pineapple stem for example).

Things you can check into &#8230;<br />\n*Mushroom tea &#8211; certain kinds of mushrooms are very effective<br />\n*Apricot seeds &#8211; supposed to be extremely powerful<br />\n*Juicing &#8211; I heard that drinking green juice for three months is supposed to entirely replace your blood.<br />\nAlso, beet juice is a POWERFUL blood cleanser<br />\n*Check out youtube videos. A lot of interesting cancer testimonials and healthfood doctors on there.<br />\nYou&#8217;re right about alkalizing the body. I&#8217;m hearing more and more about that too. There&#8217;s a doctor on youtube that goes into that. If you type in cancer + alkalinity I think you will pull him up. He has a mustache&#8230; can&#8217;t remember his name. He&#8217;s very impressive (a European) and goes more into that in detail.<br />\nAnd one more thing, Ivona, I just have to recommend a book to you that I think might really mean a lot to you&#8230; I buy used copies all the time to give to people. &#8220;MY GLIMPSE OF ETERNITY&#8221; by Betty Malz. It&#8217;s an amazing true story. A woman dies while on vacation and tells what she saw on the other side. I would give you a copy if I knew you. I&#8217;ve personally heard of people whose lives have changed after reading this book. You know, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any mistake you&#8217;ve survived cancer four times! I think God has a purpose for you here.

It is possible to hold the high pH for many months but it could be causing extra kidney/liver/gall stones which you would then need to address another way. This diet will hold you in good stead.

MRI pending.  I had heard of the maple syrup treatment some time ago and wondered at that time, Why maple syrup?  The logic of cancer cells taking in glucose spiked with bicarb is brilliant.  My research showed that maple syrup was actually quite low in glucose so I went in search of a higher % glucose product.  What I found was glucose = dextrose = corn syrup = Karo light.  There are other sources of glucose but none so easy to get.  Two cautions.  Folks with corn allergy&#8217;s find another source and the Karo on my local store&#8217;s shelves has vanilla added.  I am going to make another pass at finding corn syrup with nothing added.  If anyone knows a reason to use maple syrup I&#8217;d sure like to know.  After I mix the bicarb and syrup I&#8217;m considering reducing it to hard candy for a pleasant way to take my medicine.  Another thought I had was that the stomach might separate the two components and totally screw up the plan.  An alternative I&#8217;m considering is making some very sweet rectal suppositories.  The &#8220;candies&#8221; would be absorbed directly into the blood stream bypassing the stomach..  Next best thing to an IV.  An enema is another way.  My other plan is to mix bicarb with DMSO for an all over body lotion.  I think I need some PH measuring strips to track progress and make sure I don&#8217;t overdo it.  Also need a starting point to see if I;m having any affect at all.</p>\n<p>Anyone know a site where people have been reporting their experiences with these treatments?</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-claudia even depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8589\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8589\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8589\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8589\">Claudia &#8211; IMVA Staff</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8589\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8589\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>No we don&#8217;t know of such a site.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sircus recommends using black-strap molasses with the bicarbonate instead of maple syrup as it has more beneficial nutrients as well as the necessary glucose.</p>\n<p>Be very careful using anything in mucous membranes (via suppository, enemas etc.) as absorption is much different, more rapid and possibly more completely absorbed.

It is far better to learn to partake in healthier eating and whatever lifestyle changes are necessary than it is to rely on bicarbonate.  There are ways to eat more alkaline foods and drink more alkaline water than what our current diets give us today.      Older people do not metabolize the same as younger people do,  so for them, the limits in how much to take are much less than for people under age 60.     Better diet and lifestyle will better prevent cancer and be safer for us. &#8212;&#8211; Original Message &#8212;&#8211;<br />\nFrom: Disqus<br />\nTo: <a href=\"mailto:cfrench180@tampabay.rr.com\">cfrench180@tampabay.rr.com</a><br />\nSent: Friday, January 11, 2013 10:10 AM<br />\nSubject: [drsircus] Re: Baking Soda &amp; Cancer (The Last Laugh)</p>\n<p>anti_banker  wrote, in response to Claudia &#8211; IMVA Staff:<br />\nClaudia.

Just writing to mention a little-known transdermal use of baking soda I wrote an article about nearly 20 years ago&#8230; It was titled &#8220;Does your deodorant cause breast cancer?&#8221; &#8230; It talked about how most breast cancers appear in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, the area closest to the underarm, where toxin laden deodorants and antiperspirants are applied. Advocated using baking soda to control underarm odor instead by &#8220;dusting&#8221; the underarm area with baking soda. To make this easiest, I store my baking soda in a dusting powder dish and use a powder puff to apply the dry baking soda under the arm. The baking soda is sufficiently alkaline to kill the underarm bacteria that cause odor, and it is the best underarm odor control substance I have found, effective for days. All my friends who try it stay with it. Just a little FYI. Best wishes, Kerri Colegrove</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8586\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8586\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8586\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8586\">Diane</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8586\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8586\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Have you ever tried Milk of Magnesia for under arm deodorant?

He has resisted having the bladder removal operation which the doctors say is his only hope.  He had tried a few alternative methods which included a baking soda cure.  It was to be mixed with either maple syrup or blackstrap molasses.  The theory was that since cancer cells want sugar, when sugar is mixed with baking soda it is more readily taken in by the cancer tumour &#8211; sort of like the Trogen horse idea.  He lives on his own and refused to go for follow-ups with doctors to see if he was winning.  He got really sick and had to go to the hospital.  Apparently the cancer tumour grew and blocked the kidneys from working &#8211; which killed one kidney and they are trying to save the other kidney.  So, now he&#8217;s agreed to bladder removal and will have it done once they shrink the tumour since it&#8217;s bleeding heavily.

If it averages below 6.8 consistently I adjust my diet to eliminate meats and to eat more greens, I use half a squeezed fresh lemon in a glass of water twice daily and use bicarbonate when my pH averages show I need a boost to get back to alkaline. I have tested  too high in bicarbonates (serum  test)  so testing pH is absolutely crucial for me personally.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-8556\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8556\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8556\">\n                <a id=\"dsq-author-user-8556\" href=\"http://paulineoflynn@hotmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pauline</a>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8556\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8556\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>do you have an address or phone number for dr. simoncini?</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-claudia even depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8559\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8559\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8559\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8559\">Claudia &#8211; IMVA Staff</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8559\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8559\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Pauline,</p>\n<p>regarding contacting Dr. Tulio Simoncini:</p>\n<p>He may be contacted in Rome, Italy by his website <a href=\"http://www.cancerisafungus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cancerisafungus.com</a> and e-mail <a href=\"mailto:t.smoncini@alice.it\">t.smoncini@alice.it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-9424\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-9424\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-9424\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-9424\">Aiko</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-9424\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-9424\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p><a href=\"http://www.curenaturalicancro.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external external_icon\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.curenaturalicancro.com/</a></p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-8554\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8554\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8554\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8554\">Gay Auldridge</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8554\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8554\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>You do know though who owns the National Institutes of Health and the last thing that huge institution wants is people healing themselves, then they will cease to exist&#8230;sorry Doc&#8230;I don&#8217;t buy it and your not going to teach them anything they haven&#8217;t been already shown.

Sugar FEEDS cancer and this is ALL sugar&#8230;.&#8221;carbohydrates&#8221;.  Many times these &#8220;paid for&#8221; scientists have in the past purposely created studies to fault the ability of an element to prevent &#8220;cure&#8221; cancer and other disease for the benefit of the pharma companies.  It will do little good if the scientist give baking soda and also allows the patient to consume Krispy Kreme donuts &#8220;as an example&#8221;.  Cancer cells need a special environment to grow&#8230;change the environment and cancer cells can not survive.  The trick is to get the oxygen INTO the cancer cell without effecting the surrounding healthy cells.  I do hope this doctor has integrity in his study and will take the effect of sugar in to account as well.   No one need suffer with cancer, it is easy to get rid of.

It could be like Baron says. It also could be that less oxygen and antioxidants have to be expended in neutralizing free radicals. Whatever the mechanism or the explanations, the body is better oxygenated and harmonized. So whether you fast or use alkaline foods or substances, what counts  is that the goal is always achieved. Fasting however, is the wrong way to harmonize.</p>\n<p>Good work Dr Mark.

Haemoglobin loses its affinity for oxygen in such conditions, which are caused for example by heavy exercise.  It would be counter productive for the haemoglobin to hang onto its oxygen load at such times. This is the real key to understanding carcinogenesis, ie an acid-producing diet increases, for the above-mentioned reasons, the availability of oxygen to early-stage cancer cells, which have a far greater dependency on high oxygen saturations than do normal cells, as the former cannot utilize the Krebs Cycle for their energy needs and so must rely on the far less efficient non-Krebs pathway for producing their ATP.<br />\nBarron also thinks that excess H+ ion is soaked up by oxygen, thereby rendering the latter unavailable, whereas in reality H+ is simply removed from solution by the various organic buffers whose job is precisely this, ie to resist damaging changes in pH, which would adversely affect the configuration, and so the affinity, of the various enzymes for their substrates. This enzymatic degradation is what kills the fish, not the unavailability of oxygen.<br />\nTwo further points occur when discussing cancer, ie the body&#8217;s levels of Vitamin D, which is a known apoptotic and antiproliferative, and which if given at sufficient doseage to women with breast cancer reduces the fatal development of metastasis by 800%. And further, it would appear that women&#8217;s undergarments are soaked with fire retardant chemicals which diffuse into the breast and promote the development of the disease.<br />\nThe individual initially referred to in this article should realise that correcting an underlying pH-imbalance with bicarbonate is not the real answer to the problem. But perhaps the 2 million dollars has affected his reasoning processes.  It is akin to continually changing a vehicle tyre which is wearing away at the edge; the solution is not in fitting a new tyre, but in correcting the tracking of the steering system. Just so, pH imbalance is far better addressed by adjusting the diet to increase the bodily alkalinity to appropriate levels. Adding bicarbonate to the equation will always be strenuously resisted by the body&#8217;s buffer systems , as already indicated.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8579\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8579\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8579\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8579\">L E Morin</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8579\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8579\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Dear Mr. Webb, I am a bit scientifically challenged so I am not able to follow you in all details of your reasoning.

Edward Griffin.   Given that they absolutely trashed what very well could be a natural way of ameliorating cancer from the body, and turned those who obtained benefits from such therapy into pariahs of society, the likelihood that sodium bicarbonate and its affordability as a therapy for breast cancer will not be savaged by the Rockefeller founded American Cancer Society, all of the networked agencies associated therewith and the kleptocratic mainstream media (given the potential loss of profits) is extremely doubtful.<br />\nIf Dr. Pagel&#8217;s trials evidence safety and efficacy, I only pray that his career is not ruined or he is forced to turn against his own data for fear of his job, his grants and/or his retirement account.<br />\nRemember, each cancer patient represents hundreds of thousands of dollars to mainstream medicine and if a cure for breast cancer can be found for pennies on the dollar, what would that mean for cancer therapy profitability?<br />\nWhile we wish Dr. Pagel godsspeed, we caution everyone to read between the lines when the results come out.  The fix will be in, it&#8217;s just trying to figure out what that fix actually is.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-8547\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-8547\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-8547\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-8547\">Linda N</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-8547\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-8547\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Well said Exposition.  I don&#8217;t believe for a minute that this trial will show anything positive about baking soda as a cancer treatment.  The most likely reason it is being done is to be done in a way to disprove it.  However I also think that the reason baking soda helps is because cancer is a fungus and fungi create an acid environment to survive to the detriment of its host.  Fungi cannot survive in an alkaline environment.  Dr. Simoncini makes clear you have to get the baking soda to the tumors; in many cases injecting it right into the turmor.  This aim is NOT to change the PH of the entire body.  It is to kill the tumor. Tim Webb is also correct in that the body has an elaborate buffering system whose job is to maintain an exact pH in which enzymes can function and that pH is slightly alkaline.  The best way to do this is diet.  Also Cancer cells use fermentation to create ATP because the fungus has merged with the human cell as a type of hybrid parasite.
