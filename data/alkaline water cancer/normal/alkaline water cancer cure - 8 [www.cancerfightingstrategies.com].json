Cancer thrives in an <b>acidic environment</b>, and doesn't survive in an normal, more alkaline environment. Cancer cells make your body even more acidic as they produce lactic acid. So if you have cancer, your pH levels are low and your body is too acidic. </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>Taking action to make your body more alkaline is vital in the battle against cancer. Unfortunately... </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>The majority of the foods and drinks we consume are <u>acidic</u>, such as meat, grains and sugar, with colas and other soft drinks being highly acidic. So unless you have been eating a very healthy diet, full of fresh fruit and vegetables, your body is <i>way</i> too acidic. Creating a very good environment for cancer to grow in. </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span class=\"style9\">Actually,  too much acidity is an underlying factor in many  degenerative diseases -- diabetes, arthritis, fibromyalgia and more. A basic maxim of natural physicians is: Balance the Bioterrain. Do this first, then everything can come back to normal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\">Taking medicines or supplements for cancer while your pH is highly acidic is a bit like washing dishes in a sink of dirty water, even when you put in plenty of soap, you can't get the dishes clean.</p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>According to Keiichi Morishita in his book, <i>Hidden Truth of Cancer,</i> when your blood starts to become acidic, your body deposits acidic substances  (usually toxins) into cells to  allow the blood to remain slightly alkaline. This causes your cells to become more acidic and toxic, which  results in a decrease of their oxygen levels, and harms  their DNA and respiratory enzymes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>Over time, he theorizes, these cells increase in acidity and some die. These dead cells themselves turn into acids. However, <em>some</em> of these acidified cells may <u>adapt</u> in that environment. In other words, instead of dying - as normal cells do in an acid environment - some cells survive by becoming abnormal cells. </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>These abnormal cells are called malignant cells. Malignant cells do not correspond with brain function nor with our own DNA memory code. Therefore, malignant cells grow indefinitely and without order. <b>This is cancer.</b></span> </p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>As you can see,  he is describing, from a different point of view, the link between pH and cancer, a process by which low oxygen levels turn some cells cancerous. Alkaline water (including the water in cells)  holds a lot of oxygen. Acidic water   holds very little oxygen. So the <b>more acidic</b> your cells are, the less oxygenated they will be. To make matters worse, the <span style='color:black'>fermentation</span> process cancer cells use to produce energy creates lactic acid, further increasing acidity and reducing oxygen levels. </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\"><span style='color:black'>Sang Whang, in his book <i>Reverse Aging</i>, points out that toxins are <strong>acidic</strong>. If your blood is   too acidic, toxins will not be released from your cells into the blood. So your cells can't be detoxified. This buildup of toxins in your cells results in acidic, poorly oxygenated cells, which can turn cancerous. He explains, </span></p>\n<p class=\"style9\">&quot;In general, degenerative diseases are the result of acid waste buildups within us. When we are born, we have the highest alkaline mineral concentration and also the highest body pH. From that point on, the normal process of life is to gradually acidify. That is why these degenerative diseases do not occur when you are young. Reverse aging requires two separate steps: chemical and physical. The first step is to lower the acidity of the body so that it can dispose of acidic wastes in the blood and cellular fluids safely and easily. The second step is to physically pull out old stored wastes into the blood stream so that they can be discharged from the body.&quot;</p>\n<p class=\"style9\">As you learn about pH and cancer, you find there is a long history of reversing cancer simply by alkalizing the body. It is one of the basic strategies in the battle against cancer and for improving your health in general. </p>\n<p class=\"style110\">Virtually <em>everyone</em> with cancer has low pH levels. This is because cancer is created, and thrives, in a body that has low pH levels, a body that is acidic. Low pH causes your body to store more toxins in cells, and reduces oxygen levels, both of which are fundamental to the development of cancer. When cancer cells grow, they produce even more acid. Making it  very difficult to raise pH levels, especially when cancer is present. </p>\n<p class=\"style110\">When you take something to increase pH levels, your cells notice the difference and start to dump some of the toxins they are holding back into the bloodstream now that they have a chance to get rid of them. (Toxins are acidic and the cells won't release them if the blood is too acidic. The blood must be kept in a narrow range around neutral pH.) </p>\n<p class=\"style110\">Because the cells are releasing some of their stored toxins, your  pH levels drop again. This detoxification process can take months to complete. In addition, because cancer cells pump out lactic acid as a byproduct of how they produce energy, they create even more acidity. You need to work a long time at normalizing pH because of these factors, but as you do, you will make your body, in a sense, cancer proof.</p>\n<p class=\"style110\">Now that you know about the like between pH and cancer, you can do something about it. Because of the fundamentalness of cancer thriving in too acidic conditions, there are many sites and books or ebooks promoting various ways to beat cancer by alkalizing the body with their particular product suggestions. Coral calcium and alkaline water machines are a couple that have been pretty popular. Also a combination of oxygen catalyst drops and a high quality green drink. </p>\n<p class=\"style110\">As pH is so fundamental to fighting cancer, we did some energetic testing to get some idea as to which ways to increase pH levels in your body were best for fighting cancer. The results were pretty interesting.</p>\n<p class=\"style110\"><strong>Alkaline drops</strong>, where you put a couple in everything you drink, tested at a low <strong>35</strong>. Not very good, perhaps because they are not that healthy a thing to be doing. Getting a machine that makes alkaline  water, and drinking the water tested at <strong>135</strong>. A machine that vortex's water, oxygenates it and adds minerals to increase pH is a bit better at <strong>195</strong>. They are certainly fine to do, but not what you'd call really good. The 3 teaspoons of <strong>baking soda</strong> in water every day was a <strong>142</strong>. Taking <strong>Coral Calcium</strong> was better, a <strong>235 </strong>for fighting cancer. A high quality <strong>green drink</strong> marketed for alkalizing the body came in at a <strong>214</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"style110\"><strong>OxyDHQ</strong> tests energetically, for its pH adjusting, cancer fighting ability, at <strong>345</strong>, virtually tied with the <strong>Oxygen Catalyst</strong> used for adjusting pH, which comes in at <strong>346</strong>. (OxyDHQ tests much higher for fighting cancer, <strong>1080</strong>, because the oxygen it creates also does an especially good job of killing cancer cells. Overall for fighting cancer, the Oxygen Catalyst comes in at <strong>200</strong>, it doesn't do as good a job at fighting cancer as at adjusting pH levels.) <br />\n</p>\n<p class=\"style110\">One of the best supplements we have found for fighting cancer works in a unique way that increases pH in your body if you have cancer. But only if you have cancer.</p>\n<p class=\"style110\"> It instructs cancer cells to stop pumping the lactic acid they produce (as part of the fermentation process)  into the body. And they produce a lot of lactic acid. This lactic acid, when it is pumped out, acidifies your body. Using BLA helps to alkalize your body as it stops the cancer cells from pumping out the lactic acid.</p>\n<p class=\"style110\">By the way, if your cancer is in the lungs or stomach, and there is a lot of it, the cancer may eliminate so much lactic acid in a confined space that the body produces fluid to dilute the acidic buildup. Causing ascites or fluid buildup in these organs. <strong>BLA, Glutam, metOH </strong>and <strong>CSE</strong> help to reduce and eventually eliminate ascites.</p>\n<p class=\"style45\"><a name=\"BLA\" id=\"BLA\"></a>BLA Elixir - Blocks Lactic Acid In Cancer Cells And Raises pH Levels</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">BLA is a frequency enhanced water elixir made with the unique technology used in PrugX and many other top cancer fighters. These energies deliver an information message to your body. The instructions BLA carries to your body tell it to block the effluxion or elimination of lactic acid from all cancer cells. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What users are finding is that it takes four days for BLA to stop the lactic acid pumps in cancer cells. Lactic acid is constantly being produced by  cancer cells as they primarily ferment sugars to make their energy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"> Once BLA stops the lactic acid pumps, that lactic acid can no longer be moved out of the cancer cells. Once this happens, the lactic acid starts to build up in the cancer cell.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cancer cells produce a lot of lactic acid as it is a byproduct of the sugar fermentation they primarily use to make energy. As this lactic acid produced by the cancer cell accumulates in the cancer cells, thanks to BLA, it makes the cancer cells too acidic. Over time, the lactic acid builds up to such a level that the cancer cells becomes too acidic and they die a natural death.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This process is the opposite of trying to kill cancer cells by increasing pH levels. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It is much more effective because it uses what the cancer cells produce, lactic acid, to kill the cells, as opposed to trying to make cancer cell pH more alkaline, with alkaline minerals, alkaline water and so on. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The process of alkalizing cancer cells is slower and less effective than making them too acidic, because cancer cells naturally neutralize pH buildup with their lactic acid production. All cells, including cancer cells, die if they either get too alkaline or too acidic.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">So to explain again, cancer cells produce energy almost entirely by fermentation, breaking down sugars, as opposed to aerobically producing energy with oxygen. This fermentation process produces lactic acid as a byproduct. When you stop the elimination of lactic acid with BLA, lactic acid builds up in the cancer cell. At some point the lactic acid builds up to an amount that the cancer cells become so acidic they can no longer function, and die a natural death.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\"><strong>The buildup of lactic acid works amazingly well for causing cancer cells to die a natural death -- fast.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One researcher, Dr. Rosenberg, MD, a leading cancer doctor, using a different process to block the lactic acid pumps in cancer cells, fed a patient a huge amount of sugar by giving him glucose IVs -- once the lactic acid pumps were blocked. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Feeding cancer cells sugar caused them to produce much more lactic acid then they normally would. In fact, the more sugar he gave his patient, the faster the cancer cells died because the lactic acid built up faster in the cells. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He brought the tumor markers in one advanced cancer patient down to 0 in 30 days. A second patient's markers dropped 40% in 2 weeks. Truly amazing results.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In use since early 2011, BLA is proving to be one of the top cancer fighting supplements we have researched. Especially when used with PrugX, a sister elixir that causes a build up of hydrogen peroxide in cancer cells. They work synergistically together, creating a toxic soup of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in cancer cells. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">You can read more about PrugX  in the Antioxidants and Cancer section of this site. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The hydrogen peroxide buildup causes free radical damage to cancer cells. PrugX was developed to tell the body to stop the release of hydrogen peroxide by cancer cells after researchers discovered that cancer cells were continually producing hydrogen peroxide and releasing it to damage nearby healthy cells.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When using BLA you can more rapidly increase the build up of lactic acid in the cancer cells by doing what Dr. Rosenberg did, increase consumption of sugars so that the cancer cells eat more and thus make more lactic acid. Any sugar will work, but as refined sugars tend to wipe out the immune system response, natural sugars are better. Early on the recommendation with BLA was to do just this. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">However, when using many other cancer fighting elixirs, additional sugar is not needed. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The combination causes cancer cells to die quickly without consuming extra sugar. And feeding cancer cells sugar will increase their energy. This combination is now focused on shutting down the energy production of cancer cells so that they are starving for energy along with suffering an overload of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Even from the first, without PrugX, BLA was producing impressive results.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\"><strong>Dean Edmonds reported that his PSA had been rising every month, from 940.6 in February of 2011 to 3778.7 on May 11, 2011. This was when he stated using BLA, a couple of other supplements, and honey. On June 7, 2011, less than a month later, his PSA test came in at 77.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\">Another user writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\">&quot;You will know that I started taking  [BLA, Custom Elixir pH and Zeolite Enhanced with DHQ] some 7 weeks ago. My local doctor is fully aware of what I am doing and is being very supportive. I had my blood tested at that time ( 7 weeks ago). \n      At that time all my liver functions were normal apart from the tumor marker which showed a level of over 11.000 (eleven thousand) My blood was re-checked last week and yesterday my doctor advised me &nbsp;of the results. The tumor marker had reduced dramatically to 1400 ( fourteen hundred ) back down to the level when the cancer was diagnosed some 12 months ago.... <br />\n      &nbsp;<br />\n      &quot;You should be aware that I have undertaken three separate chemo treatments already none of which showed any improvement in the tumor marker, as I said above it actually increased!<br />\n      &nbsp;<br />\n      &quot;I should probably add that my doctor was totally astounded by the results!!&quot;<br />\n      Len S. </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">If you are not using BLA, it is best to avoid consuming carbohydrates like sugar that feed the cancer. But when you are using BLA, once the lactic acid pumps have been shut down, the additional lactic acid that is produced by the cancer cells when you feed them sugar stays in the cancer cells. The faster you increase levels of lactic acid, by feeding them sugars, the faster the cancer cells die a natural death.</p>\n<p><strong>BLA raises overall body pH levels too.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When the cancer cells have stopped pumping out the lactic acid they produce, your pH levels naturally will start to increase. One Naturopath tested BLA on 10 of her patients with advanced cancer. At the end of two months every one had increased their overall pH levels significantly, most by at least .75, some by a full point some by half a point. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In addition, the CA markers all went down, most by around 20%, one was 10% and another by 25%. All these are significant scores, and they were caused by BLA alone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style452\" id=\"Glutam\">Glutam  Prevents Cancer Cells From Neutralizing The Lactic Acid Buildup Caused By BLA </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">L-Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Your body needs it  for ensuring nitrogen balance, maintaining gut integrity, and keeping your immune system strong.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Unfortunately glutamine also is avidly used by cancer cells in many ways. It is metabolized for fuel. In fact, one reason cancer can grow when you are on a no sugar, low carb diet is because it will burn glutamine in place of glucose sugar to make the energy it needs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Glutamine also supplies nitrogen to cancer cells so that they can function correctly, and in general, promotes the growth of cancer cells. Even more importantly, it unfortunately helps cancer cells thwart efforts to destroy them. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There are three primary actions using glutamine that protect cancer cells and enable them to grow and thrive.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>First, glutamine stimulates production of glutathione in cancer cells.</strong> Glutathione is a major antioxidant enzyme. You want to have glutathione, lots of it, in healthy cells. However glutathione protects cancer cells from free radical damage. Many types of chemotherapy and the  elixir PrugX, kill cancer cells by causing free radical damage the DNA in cancer cells.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When cells have plentiful glutamine, they can make enough glutathione to prevent destruction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Secondly, when cancer cells have excess glutamine, they are able to exchange it for essential amino acids needed to prevent  cell death when cells are badly damaged and poorly functioning.</strong> This process of destroying damaged cells is called autophagy, and is an important component of natural cancer cell death. Glutamine, excess glutamine at any rate, prevent this.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Third and most important, researchers have discovered that glutamine buffers or neutralizes lactic acid buildup in cancer cells.</strong> As we have talked about in this article, cancer cells produce most of their energy through the metabolism of glucose sugars (and glutamine too). This produces excess lactic acid that would lower pH in cancer cells to such a low level that they would die.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cancer cells deal with this in two primary ways. They pump out of the cell as much lactic acid as they can. And they metabolize glutamine. When glutamine is metabolized, ammonia is produced. Researchers have discovered that ammonia will neutralize acid buildup. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cancer cells grown in a dish that had no glutamine as a food source could not survive low pH levels but would grow rapidly in high pH environments. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cancer cells that had glutamine as a food source were found to consume more glutamine as pH was lowered -- and not die at the low pH levels. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When the glutaminase enzyme used to metabolize glutamine was inhibited, cancer cell survival dropped when pH was lowered -- causing the cancer cells to become more acidic.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What this means is that the cancer cells in your body  depend on glutamine to survive -- especially when BLA is used. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They can pump out lactic acid to remove some of it, (until BLA stops that process). Cancer cells metabolize glutamine to make some of their energy, and the byproduct of this energy production is ammonia which will neutralize the lactic acid. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This mechanism explains why BLA  hasn't caused all cancer cells to die quickly. They die, but not as quickly as they would because it takes a longer period of time to build up the lactic acid levels when glutamine is available to metabolize.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The cancer cells metabolize more glutamine to make  energy which  produces more ammonia which neutralizes the lactic acid buildup caused by BLA. Or at least some of the build up -- slowing down the process of cancer cell death by acidosis.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It doesn't do any good to stop consumption of foods that supply glutamine. Researchers note that cancer cells will always get enough from the glutamine that is made by the body. So stopping the consumption of glutamine will only harm our healthy cells. For example, your body will not be able to make as many immune cells to fight cancer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Stopping glutamine consumption would also create a serious negative nitrogen balance in the body. Nitrogen depletion is tied to Cachexia or muscle wasting that is the principle cause in about a third of all deaths from cancer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">So what can be done to deal with this issue?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Glutam </strong>is the solution as it targets cancer cells with  instructions to stop the use of glutamine in cancer cells.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It is a frequency enhanced elixir that, like BLA, PrugX and other frequency enhanced elixirs, carries a set of instructions -- in the form of vibrational frequencies of the subtle energies of those instructions -- into the body. The instructions turn off the metabolism of glutamine by cancer cells only. They stop production or uptake of the glutaminase enzymes needed to metabolize glutamine. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Glutam also tells the body to reduce the amount of glutamine that is absorbed by cancer cells. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As a consequence of using Glutam, cancer cells will have less glutamine in them, and less of that glutamine will be metabolized. This results in an inability to neutralize the lactic acid buildup caused by BLA. This increased lactic acid buildup will cause faster cancer cell death. This is a natural death that does not initiate an inflammatory response by the immune system.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Glutam will also help PrugX  work more effectively. PrugX causes a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in cancer cells. This hydrogen peroxide causes free radical damage to cancer cells. Glutam, by reducing the amount of glutamine in cancer cells, will reduce the ability of cancer cells to produce glutathione. Glutathione would neutralize the free radicals in hydrogen peroxide.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fortunately this next supplement is a unique highly alkaline OH water concentrate that actually helps BLA to work better.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style64\"><a name=\"pHenOH\" id=\"pHenOH\"></a>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH &nbsp;Mitochondrial Energy Tonic -- and AlkalOH Gel</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Do NOT use metOH in more than a half a bottle a month dosage if you need to avoid swelling of tumors, or AlkalOH gel  more than 6 times a day on a tumor when you need to avoid swelling that tumor. In higher doses, the OH water in these two supplements gets pulled into an acidic tumor and gets trapped there for a while, causing the tumor to swell.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For years we've written how alkaline water or minerals that alkalize water are good to use, but not great cancer fighters. They just didn't work as well as you'd hope they be working. So much so that if you are using BLA, we suggest  you reduce their use as they  interfere with the action of BLA to a small extent, and BLA is much more effective. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">BLA causes a cancer cell to become too acidic, which will  kill it faster than trying to increase its pH. Alkaline water or minerals that enter a cancer cell would neutralize the lactic acid buildup BLA causes -- to some extent -- and help protect the cancer cell.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With the development of m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH and AlkalOH, you now can use an energized, highly alkaline concentrate that works synergistically with BLA to greatly increase the effectiveness of both. Better still, it is much more effective than ordinary alkaline water or alkaline minerals are.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The base of <strong>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH</strong> is a patented super OH water concentrate that is 300% stronger than 8.0 alkaline water or mineral solutions that alkalize water such as baking soda and water or coral calcium. As a concentrate it is about 12.5 pH. Mixed in distilled water to drink, the pH is 11, which is 300% more alkaline than 8.0 pH.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It also does a much better job of removing acids (which includes toxins) from your body.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Unlike alkaline water from machines, or any other alkaline water, m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH actually seeks out and removes hydrogen containing acids from the body.  Removing these acids is the key to health. The water in m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH has had one hydrogen atom removed from it in a patented process,  thereby turning H2O into OH water. </p>\n<p>This OH water is a  stable water that badly wants to get its missing Hydrogen ions back. So when you drink it, it is greatly attracted to molecules with excess hydrogen ions, and binds with them. The molecules with excess hydrogen are acids. Acids like lactic acid and uric acid, or toxins -- which are also acidic.</p>\n<p>Excessive hydrogen causes the body to be acidic. The more toxins and acids you have in your body, the more excess hydrogen there is, and the more acidic your body will be. m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH helps replace the hydrogen molecules with oxygen. The less hydrogen  there is, the more oxygen there will be. </p>\n<p>Just as too many toxins and acids will cause an acidic, low oxygen environment ripe for the development of cancer, reversing this process and reducing acidity while increasing oxygenation will create an environment where cancer can't grow.</p>\n<p>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH  removes acid faster than is possible to do with minerals or alkaline water. It more directly wants the acids and binds with them because it is missing that hydrogen ion. </p>\n<p>In addition, with the same technology used for the elixirs, it is  infused with specific energetic frequencies at the molecular level. These  instructions turn m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH into a very large, 1 liter, elixir that has been instructed to  kill cancer, infection causing pathogens, and to optimize detoxification.</p>\n<p> These energetic instructions  increase the original effectiveness of m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH by approximately 45% when it comes to healing cancer.</p>\n<p>Again, the best way to remove  acids and toxins in your body is to drink  m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH diluted in water. It wants hydrogen. So it seeks out and binds with acids (including toxins) because they have the hydrogen that it is seeking.</p>\n<p>The body gets rid of the hydrogen molecules as it does all water, through the urine. You will literally urinate  acids and toxins out of your body without putting a major burden on the liver to handle these toxins. </p>\n<p>Nothing else we have tested removes acids and toxins so effectively. When acids and toxins are removed by m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH, your body will oxygenate much better. m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH then becomes one of the best oxygenation supplements we supply. This oxygenation will heal your cells, kill cancer cells and pathogens and improve the overall health in your body. </p>\n<p>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH is a concentrate so you mix it with water. Distilled water is best, but a good filtered water with no added minerals will be almost as good.</p>\n<p> In every glass of  m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH there are trillions of oxygen atoms with free electrons looking to bind up a hydrogen atom and safely remove it and the acid connected to it from your body. In addition to healing cancer, m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH can help you gain energy, lose excess weight, speed recovery from exercise, decrease soreness, detoxify, boost the immune system, the list goes on. </p>\n<p>In our energetic testing for healing cancer, m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH tests at a high <strong>11,500 </strong>when taken internally Use 2 or 3 bottles a month.</p>\n<p> It will  both heal cancer and eliminate  toxins that have accumulated in the body. This removal of toxins can be most important when someone is suffering from  too many chemotherapy toxins building up in the body. This toxicity is poisoning you, causing chemo side effects like nausea, tiredness and hair loss.</p>\n<p>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH is particularly important to use when you or a loved one is suffering from this over toxicity caused by chemotherapy. Those toxins must be eliminated if the body is to recover and heal.</p>\n<p><strong>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH -- Excellent for Healing Lung Cancers</strong></p>\n<p>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH is remarkably effective at healing lung cancers when,  as a concentrate, is breathed into the lungs by using  a nebulizer or personal steamer or personal vaporizer. </p>\n<p>When breathed into the lungs, m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH will directly kill  lung cancer cells, reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, and also help stop production of mucus in the lungs. In addition it will battle lung infections too. </p>\n<p><strong>The direct action of the highly alkaline 12.5 pH m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH concentrate on the cancer cells helps it work directly on the cancer in the lungs -- when breathed into the lungs with a nebulizer.</strong></p>\n<p>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH's high pH will disrupt and kill cancer cells. The oxygenation that occurs as  it removes acids also  kills cancer cells -- along with improving lung function. In addition....</p>\n<p>Since m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH binds with acids and toxins and carries them through the lung walls, out of the lungs., the lungs won't have to be producing as much mucus to protect its cells from those acids and toxins. Better still....</p>\n<p>Fluid buildup in the lungs, called ascites, is almost always caused by all the lactic acid being pumped out of the cancer cells. Its what they do. They've got to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>The lungs are a confined space holding this lactic acid. So much of it can be produced when there is a large amount of cancer cells in the lungs, that the acidity of it would harm lung cells. To prevent this,  the body pushes fluid into the lungs to dilute the acidity of the mixture. </p>\n<p>This causes serious breathing problems as the lungs fill up with water, and the lungs may need to be drained. m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH, by binding with this lactic acid,  and  BLA, by preventing the cancer cells from pumping the lactic acid out of their cells, are the two top supplements to prevent and reverse this fluid buildup.</p>\n<p>The OH water vapor of the nebulized m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH, in the lungs, will neutralize this lactic acid, carrying it out of the lungs --  to be removed by the kidneys. When enough of it get removed, the body will stop producing the extra fluid and the lungs will dry out.</p>\n<p>Coughing may also be decreased when mucus production is reduced. (At some point  coughing is likely to increase as dead cancer cells are being coughed out.)</p>\n<p>If you have a small amount of cancer in the lungs, use 2 bottles of m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH a month. If you have a lot of cancer in the lungs, use 3 bottles a month.</p>\n<p>If using 2 bottles a month in a nebulizer, you would do 4 sessions a day, putting  2 of the m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH bottle capfuls in the nebulizer for each session. That's 2 teaspoons.. If using 3 bottles a month, the maximum dosage, you would do 6 sessions a day. </p>\n<p>In our energetic testing of m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH, used in a nebulizer for lung cancers of all types, it is a very high <strong>16,000.</strong> As it directly kills cancer in the lungs, it is a remarkable lung cancer healer.</p>\n<p><strong>m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH -- Even Better When Used With BLA and Glutam</strong></p>\n<p>While other alkaline supplements and waters interfere with the actions of the BLA and Glutam m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH works so differently that it actually enhances their effectiveness. Or you could say, BLA and Glutam significantly improve the effectiveness of m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH.</p>\n<p>There are so many acids outside cancer cells that this OH water is attracted to, it is not attracted into cancer cells until BLA and Glutam have caused a significant buildup of lactic acid in those cells. At this point the ionic charge is strong enough to pull m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH into the cancer cells. It is so alkaline, and there is such a significant amount of lactic acid in the cell, the cancer cells go into shock from their pH changing so rapidly. </p>\n<p>They can't adjust to this change, and die.</p>\n<p class=\"style452\">AlkalOH Gel -- Great for Tumors Close To The Skin and Skin Cancers</p>\n<p>AlkalOH is an OH water concentrate in a gel form. It is designed for use on the skin. It supplies an OH water concentrate which gets pushed deep into the body by the DMSO that is in it. This gel is highly alkaline, with a pH close to 12. Yet it is completely safe to use on the skin and is  an excellent moisturizer.</p>\n<p>Just like m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH, AlkalOH removes acids and toxins. As it does this, it oxygenates and heals. This oxygen will accelerate healing of wounds in the skin. It will refresh and regenerate the skin. </p>\n<p>More valuable, of course is the action of the extremely high pH gel on cancer cells. Both for skin cancer and in tumors close to the skin like breast tumors or cancer in the liver or stomach.</p>\n<p>The DMSO that is part of AlkalOH will drive the OH water into these areas. Just like m&sdot;e&sdot;t&sdot;OH acting on lung cancer cells, this direct action on the tumor or skin cancer will do a powerful job of knocking out these tumors and cancers.</p>\n<p> AlkalOH is an excellent product for working on tumors close to the skin. If you use it enough times in a day. </p>\n<p>You can use it topically 6 times a day to reduce inflammation and to heal the skin. Use up to 12 or more times a day for dealing with tumors or larger masses of cancers.</p>\n<p>Our energetic testing puts its healing power in these situations at a high <strong>16,300 </strong>meaning it is excellent for dealing with  tumors close to the surface of the skin. When BLA and Glutam are also used with AlkalOH, they help it work better.</p>\n<p>AlkalOH can be used anywhere  the cancer is within 3 inches of your skin. You don't have to be able to feel or see the cancer. If it is reasonably close to the surface, put AlkalOH on your skin as often as possible. The OH concentrate in it will be driven down deep enough in this formulation to help heal cancers within 3 inches of the skin above it.</p>\n<p>For best results, wash area each time before reapplying AlkalOH. If washing is inconvenient, still reapply the AlkalOH. You will get most of its benefits without washing.</p>\n<p>AlkalOH comes in a 4 ounce bottle. While it goes a long way, depending on the area you are covering, and how often you are applying it, you may need to use several bottles a month. </p>\n<p>Ingredients include Water, Proprietary High Alkaline Blend, DMSO, Xanthan Gum, and the essential oils of Angelica Root, Cedar Wood, Fir Needle, Frankincense, Pine Needle, Spruce, and Lemon.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\"><a name=\"mc2\" id=\"mc2\"></a> <span class=\"style452\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>CSE - Cell Support Elixir</strong><strong></strong></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">CSE is a frequency enhanced water elixir that uses the same technology that BLA and PrugX use. It delivers a different set of instructions to your body, working in an entirely different way to fight cancer. CSE significantly enhances the ability of a couple of the top cancer fighters covered on this site, ESME which is written up on the Immune System section, and BLA. As such, it is one of the more important cancer fighters to use.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The fundamental set of instructions CSE has interacts with the water in the body, causing a reduction in the size of the clusters of the water. This reduction in size has several benefits for overall health and for fighting cancer. Circulation would improve slightly and fluids can travel further along tiny capillaries. Even the lymph system should flow a little better. This is all good, however it is at the cellular level that CSE shines.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">CSE improves the ability of toxins to be removed from cells, as those toxins would be carried out in the smaller sized clusters of water that CSE creates. This will enable more toxins to be carried through the cell wall. As the underlying cause of most cancers is excess toxicity in cells, this action of CSE is significant for its ability to prevent the development of cancer and to fight cancer also. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Because toxins are acidic, the improved cellular detoxification action of CSE also improves cellular pH levels. This improved pH also translates into better oxygenation of cells. Both are actions that make it harder for cells to turn cancerous.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Along with improving transport of oxygen into cancer cells, the reduced size of water clusters caused by CSE increases absorption of nutrients into cells. This action plays a small but significant part in preventing and fighting cancer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Your cells are more than just a nucleus, mitochondria, enzymes, intercellular fluid and a cellular membrane. They are also electric. They are energetic in nature. Both in how the communicate with other cells in your body, and in how well they may function based on their energy. The energies in CSE optimize the energetic functioning of your normal cells. And more importantly when you have cancer, they disrupt the functioning of cancerous cells to such an extent that they can cause cancer cells to die. It is this action that is most valuable for improving the ability of ESME and BLA to fight cancer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">On its own, CSE tests at <strong>8600</strong> for fighting cancer. Use 3 bottles a month for early stage cancers and 4 bottles a month for advanced cancers. Use 5 bottles a month for very advanced cancers when you need to be more vigorous. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"style452\" id=\"OCMP\">OCMP - <strong>Optimize Cell Membrane Potential To  Prevent Cancer</strong></span><strong><br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n</strong>OCMP boosts the Cell Membrane Potential (helping the walls of the cells work better), optimizes cellular chemistry and increases  cell efficiency. This  improves:</p>\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Cellular protection and fortification by preventing  toxins and pathogens from entering cells.</li>\n    <li><br align=\"justify\" />\n      Cell repair and recovery by increasing nutrient flow and access into cells.</li>\n    <li><br align=\"justify\" />\n      Cell hygiene and detoxification by speeding waste transfer and elimination of toxins from cells.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">The key factors influencing&nbsp;the ability of cell walls to uptake oxygen and other nutrients, and to eliminate toxins, are positive and negative ion concentrations inside and outside the cell walls. These ions work together creating &ldquo;electrical gradients&rdquo; within our tissues. These gradients are what keep cell membranes strong and determine how well our cells and nerves function. &nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The key elements or ions involved are sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl&ndash;), and calcium (Ca2+). These four elements are found in abundance in almost every diet but are often severely imbalanced at a cellular level. Increasing their intake does not automatically improve Cell Membrane Potential. Indeed in many cases, CMP may actually decrease with mineral supplementation. &nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The proprietary&nbsp;OCMP formulation is doctor designed to provide therapeutic levels of what we call the ionic gatekeeper nutrients. Among these; high levels of bio-available magnesium is key. Zinc, chromium, manganese, lithium and germanium also contribute. These elements help spark the production and release  of calcium and chloride ions, processes essential to continued robust health because they insure that toxins will be better eliminated from your cells, and that nutrients including oxygen will be better absorbed. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This process is fundamental to the prevention of cancer, in addition to being vital for overall health. As far as pH and cancer go, what makes OCMP such a powerful cancer fighter is that it is able to literally alkalize cancer cells, killing them much more effectively than even alkalizers like Cesium Chloride can do because it is able to drive more minerals into the cancer cells. Thus its  healing power of <strong>1300 </strong>in our energetic testing. Better still, when compared to Cesium, it contributes to the health and well being of every cell in your body. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Further,&nbsp;OCMP enhances the cells methylation capacity and nutritionally supports mood elevation. Daily use will positively contribute to the detoxification process and help protect the cells and brain from mercury and other neuro toxins. It augments the body&rsquo;s natural pain-relief and stress recovery processes.&nbsp;OCMP is also a premium anti-aging nutraceutical which, through the individual and synergistic action of its ingredients, may strongly assist in the recovery of youthful function in organs, joints and skin.&nbsp; </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Includes therapeutic levels of: Magnesium (chelated, ionic and soluble), TriMethylGlycine (cellular repair and protection), N-Acetyl Glucosamine (intestinal, joint and skin repair and protection), Germanium 132 (cellular oxygen utilization), with supporting levels of organic lithium, selenium, zinc, iodide, vitamins and a full range of trace minerals and absorption assisting cofactors. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style45\"><strong>Ascites Fluid Buildup -- What Causes It and What To Do About It</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ascites is a buildup of water and fluid in the stomach or lungs caused by cancer and or excess toxicity. It is one of the tougher issues to deal with if you've got cancer. And there hasn't been a whole lot you can do about it other than getting the fluid drawn when the stomach or lungs get too full. Or of course, knocking out that cancer. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The fundamental reason this accumulation of fluid occurs has to do with acidity. Thus, we discuss it here in the pH section. When there is a great deal of  lactic acid being eliminated by  cancer cells, or by the killing of the cancer cells which releases acidic waste,  the body may need to dilute this acid buildup with fluid. The build up is so acidic, it would be harmful to cells if it was not diluted. Many times chemotherapy and a poorly functioning liver cause an acidic buildup of toxins that need to be diluted with fluid. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">So your body produces fluid to dilute the acid in an attempt to protect itself. Sometimes it is a poorly functioning liver that is the reason the body can't get rid of the acids -- which can include chemo toxins. Sometimes a poorly functioning kidney. Sometimes there is just too much acid for a poorly functioning detox system to handle. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\" class=\"style110\"><strong>What To Do To Reduce and Eventually Eliminate Ascites Fluid Buildup</strong></p>\n<p>For dealing with Ascites or, fluid build up in a body cavity due to cancer, we recommend the following supplements. Both the Pentose Phosphate Pathway Elixir and BLA also work to fight cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Lung Ascites</strong></p>\n<p>If the ascites is in the lungs, then  lactic acid buildup, which the body tries to delete with fluid, is the main issue.  In order of importance, the supplements to use to deal with this are the following. The more you can use, the faster the ascites will disappear. </p>\n<p>It may well take a couple of months to stop the fluid buildup. First, the amount of time fluid takes to build up  gradually decreases. Eventually it stops altogether.</p>\n<p>There are three vital supplements to use. </p>\n<p>3 bottles a month of <strong>Pentose Phosphate Pathway Elixir</strong>  \u00a0 This elixir disables the pentose phosphate pathways in cancer cells which metabolism glucose and produce lactic acid as a side effect. Less lactic acid will be produced by cancer cells when this is used. It is also one of the top 3 cancer fighters.</p>\n<p>2 bottles a month <strong>metOH</strong> \u00a0   Use this in a nebulizer for ascites in the lungs. This OH water will neutralize lactic acids as it binds with it. Decreased acidity means the body will not need to dilute the acidity with fluids to protect cells from high acidity.</p>\n<p>Do not use this if there is cancer in the throat, or elsewhere in the lungs where swelling of a tumor would cause problems. metOH tends to get pulled into tumors, and could swell them up with water.</p>\n<p>3\u00a0 bottles a month <strong>BLA</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0This elixir tells cancer cells to stop pumping out the lactic acid.\u00a0The lactic acid that is produced by the cancer cell will stay in the cell, poisoning it.</p>\n<p>Very Good to add on if you want to more vigorously reduce fluid build up, are the following supplements. These are listed in order of importance for dealing with ascites. </p>\n<p>2 bottles a month <strong>OCMP</strong>   \u00a0 This  magnesium based supplements  gets the cell walls working properly so that toxins can be removed and nutrients better absorbed. It will work to neutralize acids in the body, and help cells detoxify.</p>\n<p>3 bottles a month <strong>CSE</strong>\u00a0  This elixir  improves pH and makes water molecules smaller. These smaller sized water molecules will be able to leave the confines of the lungs or stomach more easily.</p>\n<p>3\u00a0 bottles a month <strong>OxyDHQ</strong> \u00a0  This oxygenation supplement also improves pH in the body. OyDHQ is actually one of the most valuable supplements to be using overall because of need for additional oxygen by the body when cancer, especially with fluid buildup, is in the lungs,  and they are not working well. OyDHQ is  vital to use for this reason, as is Ronuv.</p>\n<p><strong>Abdominal Ascites</strong></p>\n<p>If the ascites is in the abdominal area, there is an additional factor causing fluid accumulation. Toxicity. Usually this is from chemotherapy which a poorly performing liver is unable to get rid of. As a consequence, there is a soup of lactic acid and acidic toxins in a confined area, the stomach, and the body puts fluid into that space to dilute the acidity and toxicity. </p>\n<p>To counteract this the liver must be supported so that it starts working more effectively. Additionally, toxins must be neutralized.</p>\n<p>The three most vital supplements to use for abdominal ascites are\u2026.</p>\n<p>3 bottles a month of <strong>Pentose Phosphate Pathway Elixir</strong></p>\n<p>2 bottles a month <strong>Liver Strength</strong>  \u00a0 This is the large 360 capsule sized bottle, not the 185 size bottle. Liver Strength is a powerful liver support supplement that pushes toxins out of the liver, supports the brain and immune system too. It is possible to get by with 1 bottle a month, but 2 per month will produce faster results.</p>\n<p>3 bottles a month <strong>Glutathione Force</strong> \u00a0  This is a liposomal glutathione supplement that will absorb toxins in cells. Using  liposomal glutathione is one of the fastest ways to neutralize toxins. Glutathione Force is the most advanced liposomal glutathione available. Its emulsified oil and water blend delivers glutathione, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, folic acid and other nutrients directly into cells. Using Glutathione Force will also help with nausea and vomiting as it clears toxins from the abdominal area.</p>\n<p>Important to add on in addition, if at all possible, are the following supplements, which are listed in order of their value for helping with abdominal ascites.</p>\n<p>2 bottles a month <strong>Liver Detox Pathways Elixir</strong> \u00a0  This elixir optimizes function of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the detoxification pathways in the liver.  This helps the liver to better deal with toxins. Repair of these pathways is essential if your body is going to detoxify. This elixir gives instructions to the body to produce the enzymes needed for these pathways to work. As such, it is fundamental to the detoxification process when the body is heavily overloaded with toxins.</p>\n<p>3\u00a0 bottles a month <strong>BLA</strong>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>2 bottles a month <strong>metOH</strong>. \u00a0 Mix this in water and drink when you have fluid buildup in the abdominal area. (If the stomach is full of fluid, only use equal amounts of metOH and water, not a quart or pint, as it will mix with the fluid in the stomach. Once there, this OH water will bind with lactic acid and acids from toxins, and neutralize them. Decreased acidity means the body will not need to dilute the acidity with fluids to protect cells from high acidity.</p>\n<p>Do not use this if there is cancer that could block the stomach, where swelling of a tumor would cause problems. metOH tends to get pulled into tumors and will swell them up with water.</p>\n<p>3 bottles a month <strong>CSE</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Next, let's take a look at how we can supercharge some types of chemotherapy to make them more effective.</p>\n<div align=\"right\"><span class=\"style9\"><a href=\"/methylglyoxal.html\">NEXT</a></span></div>\n    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- This clearing element should immediately follow the #mainContent div in order to force the #container div to contain all child floats -->\n\t<br class=\"clearfloat\" />\n\t<div id=\"footer\">\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
