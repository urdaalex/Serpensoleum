Eidem<br />Author of <em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></p>\r\n<p>Revici made  this important finding about cancer etiology a few years after the biochemist  Otto Warburg famously announced that the cause of cancer is due to the  replacement of oxygen in normal cells by the fermentation of sugar. Revici's  subsequent findings went largely unnoticed, however, because the results were  grievously misreported three times in a major medical journal.</p>\r\n<p>Since Otto  Warburg, many in the holistic health community have believed that cancer is due  to hyper-acidity and that a major part of reversing cancer is to alkalize the  patient. Revici found that not only does hyper-acidity produce cancer, so does  constant alkalinity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>An instructive case history</strong></p>\r\n<p>It might be  best to start with an example of a patient that was treated due to being too  acidic <em>and</em> to being too alkaline at  different times during her recurrent illness.</p>\r\n<p>The case  study that follows is particularly interesting due to how it illustrates that  simply using alkalizing agents would not have worked. In fact, the patient  would have died if the singular approach of alkalizing had been followed. In 1961, when Dr. Revici was awarded a medal  by a prestigious group whose board included 14 Nobel Prize winning scientists,  he related a case regarding a woman whom he saved three times from cancer. This  patient was treated in a bygone era when patients were often not told they had  cancer.</p>\r\n<p>In her first  bout, she had ovarian cancer with metasteses to the liver, spleen, intestine  and her intestinal lining. A biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Revici's testing  confirmed she was too anabolic.</p>\r\n<p>With  treatment her cancer cleared up. That outcome, by itself, is fairly striking  considering her original state.</p>\r\n<p>Because she  was never told she had cancer, she stopped her treatments, against Revici's  advice. Two years later her cancer returned. Another biopsy confirmed  adenocarcinoma. Revici's tests indicated she was too catabolic this time,  however, whereas before she had the opposite anabolic imbalance.</p>\r\n<p>Yet &ldquo;in view  of the good results obtained the first time, the treatment was started again  with the same agents&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.the immediate result, however, was totally unfavorable  subjectively and objectively.&rdquo; Revici then changed to treating the over  alkalinity with the result that &ldquo;the new masses&rdquo; disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>The patient  was still not told of her condition, so she continued treatment &ldquo;but at very  irregular intervals.&rdquo; Her cancer returned yet again. She was found to be  inoperable, and was once again diagnosed through biopsy with an adenocarcinoma.  This time, her third, she was back to being too acidic (anabolic.)</p>\r\n<p>She was given  alkaline agents and her cancer once again went away. The patient was finally  informed of her condition, so &ldquo;she continued with her treatment without  interruption. Now six years after her last recurrence, and eleven years since  we first saw her, she is in perfect health.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Revici concluded  his discussion of this case with these words:</p>\r\n<p><em>We present  this case because it clearly shows how important it is to consider the specific  off-balance in order to ensure the selection of the proper agents. Incidentally  we also want to emphasize the direct relationship between treatment and the  results obtained. The fact that, in this patient, the condition evolved three  times and each time was controlled <em>only</em> when the adequate treatment was instituted, excludes the possibility of  spontaneous remission.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>In hundreds of cases, the correlation  between treatment and the results obtained has been as direct as in the case  presented above</strong>&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Pre-terminal or even terminal cases are now  seen to respond better, that is, more often, more rapidly, and more completely  with subjective and objective favorable changes.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>How to evaluate a patient's acid/alkaline balance</strong><br /> Revici  referred to these two different imbalances as &ldquo;anabolic&rdquo; and &ldquo;catabolic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Too  Anabolic - urine pH consistently below 6.2 as measured at 8 am, 1 pm, 5 pm, 9  pm</li>\r\n<li>Too  Catabolic - urine pH consistently above 6.2 as measured at 8 am, 1 pm, 5 pm, 9  pm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A healthy  person's urine will have approximately 50% of their readings above, and 50%  below, 6.2 pH, not counting readings that are at or very near 6.2 pH. Revici  found that his sickest patients were the ones whose urine pH deviated the  furthest from the balance point and were the most consistently in one direction  or the other. (For convenience, every reference to acidic is referring to urine  pH below 6.2 pH. Every reference to alkaline is for urine pH above 6.2 for  purposes of this discussion.)</p>\r\n<p>In a healthy  person, the urine pH pattern would look as follows:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"../../../../images/uploaded/Reviciimage.jpg\" border=\"0\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>In more severe cases the imbalance can be spotted in the first day - or even  the first test. For instance, an 8am alkaline reading or a 9 pm acidic reading,  especially if they are severe, would be a strong indication of the particular  imbalance. That is, a 5.5 pH at night or a 7.0 pH in the morning would be  examples of strong imbalances.</p>\r\n<p>For other  patients, three days of analysis may be required to definitely establish a  pattern.</p>\r\n<p>By 1961,  Revici had evaluated hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of urine pH  analyses. Some of his sickest patients' urine pH would never cross the balance  point, especially early in their treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Anabolic  off-balance patients would typically experience more pain in the morning, but  the pain would lessen as the day progressed. In contrast, the pain of catabolic  off-balance patients grew more pronounced as the day progressed.</p>\r\n<p>Because the  urine pH can be altered by what is eaten at a particular meal, Revici devised a  test that would more accurately measure the relationship between pH and the  patient's lesions.</p>\r\n<p>Revici's used  external lesions to see how pH of the lesions compared to pain levels and to  urine pH levels. Patients were asked to record their pain levels each hour. The  pH of the patients' lesions were put on a graph along with the patients' pain  evaluations. Two opposite pain patterns arose.</p>\r\n<p>The pain  levels corresponded to the pH off-balance. Almost always, when the patient felt  the most pain, their tested lesion was also the most off-balanced. Conversely,  when the lesion pH corresponded to being balanced, there was less pain.</p>\r\n<p>The lesions  also had the opposite pH pattern from the urine. So the patterns of pain and pH  could be seen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Catabolic Imbalance</strong><br /> Urine  pH up --&gt;  lesion pH down --&gt;  pain up<br /> Urine  pH down --&gt;  lesion pH up --&gt;  pain down</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anabolic Imbalance</strong><br /> Urine  pH down --&gt;  lesion pH up --&gt;  pain up<br /> Urine  pH up --&gt;  lesion pH down --&gt;  pain down<br /> <strong><br /> </strong>Revici was able to  determine through clinical experience that increased pain was directly related  to increased activity of the cancer. Therefore, the administration of  substances that would alter the pH to bring about &ldquo;pain down&rdquo; would have a  positive impact on the tumor and the patient's outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, this  is what occurred. Anabolic patients were administered alkalizing agents to good  effect, whereas catabolic patients were given acidifying agents to good effect,  as Revici pointed out in his address above.</p>\r\n<p>As a  practical matter measuring the pH of lesions hourly would be difficult. But  four daily urine pH measurements sufficed to monitor the patient. (Revici  developed other methods as well, but they are beyond the scope of this paper.)</p>\r\n<p>As the  patient's daily diet can cause some fluctuations, so each patient's urine would  be recorded on a weekly chart so that the pattern would become more obvious  over time. Revici later invented a reagent that would turn either bright green  or bright red in reaction to catabolic and anabolic urine, to make it easier to  see the pattern. Urine close to 6.2 would turn the reagent drops brown.</p>\r\n<p>One can use  different color markers on the chart as a visually easy way to see the  patterns.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Revici  performed a dramatic example of this anabolic/catabolic duality in cancer to a  group of visiting physicians to his <em>Instituto  de Biologia Aplicada</em> (Institute of Applied Biology), then located in  Mexico, and later relocated in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>Cancer  specialists from UCLA, the Texas Cancer Society, and McCardle observed the  demonstration. Revici prepared two glasses of water, each of which contained an  acid solution. He asked the cancer patient to select one drink and asked a  doctor in attendance to drink the other.</p>\r\n<p>The patient  was known to be on the alkaline side. Her pain went away. Meanwhile, the doctor  noticed no difference in how he felt as a result of drinking the solution.</p>\r\n<p>As a follow  up demonstration, Revici prepared two  more glasses, this time with an alkaline solution. The patient experienced a  return of her pain, while the physician who had volunteered again experienced  no change in how he felt.</p>\r\n<p>The same  demonstration was done with a cancer patient who was too acidic. The same  scenarios unfolded, only in reverse.</p>\r\n<p>While Revici  used water soluble solutions for his demonstration, he used anabolic and  catabolic lipids to treat his patients. The lipids had a more persistent  effect, plus they could act as transporters of known anti-cancer compounds,  such as selenium, at higher doses than normal.</p>\r\n<p>Some other  clinical signs and symptoms that can be indications of catabolic vs. anabolic  imbalances are as follows:<br /> <br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Recessed eyes<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Protruding eyes<br /> <br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Slow heart beat, when  caused by pathology<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Rapid heart beat, or  arrhythmia<br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Low blood pressure<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> High blood pressure<br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Insomnia<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Sleepiness, Drowsiness<br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Diarrhea<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Constipation<br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Fluid retention<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Frequent urination<br /> <strong>Catabolic:</strong> Weight gain<br /> <strong>Anabolic:</strong> Weight loss, due to  illness</p>\r\n<p><strong>Foods and supplements for anabolic and catabolic patients</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to  Revici's findings, attempting to further alkalize the catabolic patient will do  little but speed up the patient's demise. According to his theory, nutrients  such as Vitamin D, fish oil, and selenium methionine would be most helpful to  the acidic/anabolic patient, but they could accelerate the disease in overly  alkaline/catabolic patients.</p>\r\n<p>Soy, coffee  and boiled eggs should be avoided by acidic/anabolic patients, according to the  Revici Method. But sardines, <em>fried</em> eggs and even mayonnaise can temporarily lessen the pain of those with an  acid/anabolic imbalance. Emulsified cod  liver oil is especially helpful for acidic/anabolic patients.</p>\r\n<p>For the  alkaline/catabolic patient vitamin E, zinc and boron would be better choices,  according to Dr. Revici's principles. These patients also benefit from soy  sauce, coffee and <em>boiled</em> eggs.  Evening primrose oil and borage oil are the preferred oils for the  catabolic/alkaline patient.</p>\r\n<p>This little  known duality might help to explain why so many supplements and programs often  produce a 50% or a 60% success rate, but not a higher improvement level. It  also helps to explain those confounding cases where the patient seemingly did  all the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;right' things, eating like a bird, drinking alkalized water, etc., yet  they develop cancer at a relatively early age.</p>\r\n<p>That kind of  negative outcome is not so much an accident if the person is persistent in  alkalizing themselves for a long period of time&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;it's almost a foregone  conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned  previously, much of Revici's work focused on what he called the &ldquo;lipidic  defense system,&rdquo; and it is there that he attempted to modify either the  anabolic or the catabolic imbalances. The omega-3 oils, especially fish oil,  are the catabolic oils. The omega-6's are the anabolic oils. Because evening  primrose oil and barrage oil are high in GLA, they would be the preferred  anabolic oils.</p>\r\n<p>He took oils  and bound compounds to them such as selenium or sulfer. This had a great effect  and enabled him to use dosages 1,000 times greater than normal limits.</p>\r\n<p>Early in the 20th  Century, Wasserman found selenium to have anti-cancer effects, but subsequent  researchers determined that there were severe limits on how much selenium could  be used. Revici found in 1954 that binding the selenium compound to the oil  solved the toxicity challenge.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, <strong>Revici categorized each and every element  on the periodic chart as to whether it was anabolic or catabolic</strong>. With that  knowledge, he would use the appropriate elemental compounds depending on  whether the patient was too acidic or too alkaline.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Revici's success with alcohol and drug addiction</strong></p>\r\n<p>His work with  addiction provides a prime example of how he used extraordinarily high doses to  good effect. For instance, with drug addicts, he chemically bound selenium  methionine to sesame oil. In some cases, he administered as much as .25 or .5  grams (500,000 mcg!) to the patient each day up to a week with no harmful  effects. The patients did not experience any symptoms of withdrawal from their  addictions, either.</p>\r\n<p>Administering  these extreme high doses should NOT be tried by combining oils with the  micro-minerals in a mixture. Revici's medicines were chemically bound.</p>\r\n<p>Revici's drug  and alcohol treatment success was presented to a Congressional Hearing in April  of 1971, although Revici was unable to attend himself due to illness.  Congressman Charlie Rangel was intimately familiar with the program since many  of Revici's addicted patients were from his district. Rangel visited the  hospital himself accompanied by a medical administrator of the Harlem hospital  drug rehabilitation program to see what was happening. At the hearing, Rangel  said the following:</p>\r\n<p><em>The results  and what we witnessed [were] so unbelievable that the doctor from Municipal  Hospital has now gone back on a daily basis in order to continue with this  chance to see the miraculous results that have taken place&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. I have personally  gone back on several occasions to the clinic.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>The cure and the corruption</strong></p>\r\n<p>Please  forgive me for ending this article with more of a human interest slant than  what might normally be seen in this newsletter, but I want to tell you give you  a case history of a medical doctor. Dr. Bob Fishbein graduated from Harvard and  Yale, but those credentials didn't protect him from a virulent highly  undifferentiated brain tumor that carried a two-month &acirc;&euro;&tilde;end of warranty.'</p>\r\n<p>He was  justifiably upset when I knocked on his door for the first time because  security hadn't cleared my passage to his Manhattan apartment. That visit was  in 1995. Now for the shocker: Dr. Fishbein's biopsy diagnosis, performed by  none other than Dr. Harry Zimmerman, who is known as the father of  neuropathology, was made in late 1962, some 33 years after Bob was given the  bad news.</p>\r\n<p>My  unannounced visit was part of my research in writing a book about Dr. Emanuel  Revici called <em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em>.  At first, Fishbein was gun shy about discussing Dr. Revici to a stranger  because he'd seen firsthand how others had unfairly tried to destroy him. But  by the time I went to interview him, I'd already come to the conclusion that  Revici's work had saved many lives.</p>\r\n<p>With that  assurance, Fishbein told me how he had written letters asking to experts at  Harvard and Yale for any help they could provide, including Professor George  Wald, who was honored with the Nobel Prize the following year. The respondents  to his letters were kind in their replies; unfortunately they had nothing to  offer beyond their sympathy. Wald's poignant reply included these words, &ldquo;Your  letter makes me wish I knew more than I do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As Fishbein  counted his final days while desperately grasping for a solution, he recalled a  conversation he'd had six years earlier with Dr. Walter Leibling, who had been  trained in multiple specialties, concerning an unusual doctor who treated his  patients like no one else. During their long meeting, Leibling confided to  Fishbein, &ldquo;I know a doctor who melts tumors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Now that he  was a cancer patient, Fishbein called Leibling seeking his advice once again.  This time, Leibling told him, &ldquo;Go to him [Revici]. Don't argue with him, and  follow what he tells you like a religion. Don't tell anyone, and don't ask  anybody else's opinion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Other than  asking for second and third opinions, Fishbein took Leibling's advice to heart.  As a result, Bob got cured, returned to practice medicine, and even returned to  playing the violin professionally. (He had performed on the Ted Mack Amateur  Hour as a teen and won.)</p>\r\n<p>It would have been wonderful if there were a  medical study of a hundred &ldquo;highly undifferentiated brain tumor patients&rdquo; I  could point you towards to prove that the Revici Method is better than what is  available today. But I did find out about a cured Grade IV <em>glioblastoma multiforme</em> patient and other brain tumor patients who  were also cured, including one <em>astrocytoma</em> patient who had 15 &ldquo;lumps&rdquo; in her brain.</p>\r\n<p>So in lieu of  a hundred-person study, I must ask myself, how many doctors, using today's  FDA-approved methods, have cured one undifferentiated brain tumor, one Grade IV <em>glioblastoma</em>, and one <em>astrocytoma</em> during their career? Are  there many?</p>\r\n<p>Is there one?</p>\r\n<p>Maybe that is  why, when Fishbein asked John Heller, M.D., the medical director of  Sloan-Kettering, for an opinion about Revici, he told Bob, &ldquo;I've known him for  ten years. I don't know how he does it, but people walk in dead and walk out  alive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In addition  to recovering, Fishbein was an eyewitness to one of the greatest medical  injustices of the 20th Century, something he could not have done had  he not outlived his two month life expectancy. Dr. Bob gave some of his time at  Revici's hospital while he gradually recovered from his illness. What he saw  shocked him so much he wrote his own 24-page report on it.</p>\r\n<p>Injustice can  be a strong word. To understand why that description is apt, picture a medical  review team conducting their monthly discussions at the International Press  Club where the alcoholic beverage bill indicated each member of the team drank  an average of several alcoholic drinks each. Surely this sounds too bizarre to  be true, but that is what transpired when the so-called Clinical Appraisal  Group held meetings supposedly to examine the work Revici was doing.</p>\r\n<p>Nine names  appeared on the article that was subsequently published. Seven of them never  saw a patient. One of the apparent authors had demanded that his name not be  associated with the review, but his name appeared as an author anyway. When  asked about it, he said, &ldquo;It was a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But the end  result of that travesty is that you've probably never heard of Dr. Emanuel  Revici before, the 101-year-old physician who practiced medicine more than 70  years. If you have heard of him, it probably included a reference to that  worthless article. It is my hope you will hear about him and his work many  times over now.</p>\r\n<p>As Arnold  Cronk, M.D., the senior medical scientist at Johnson &amp; Johnson, said,  &ldquo;Revici is a fountain of ideas that could keep an entire graduating medical  class busy for the rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It is quite  early in this adventure - only the second century. We'll see where it goes.  Researching the work of Dr. Revici has taught me that there can be great power  in oils, especially if we use the correct ones for our acid/alkaline condition.</p>\r\n<p>Cancer  has confounded many. I firmly believe that Dr. Revici has provided some of the  missing links that explain why some patients get better while others have been  refractory to holistic approaches.</p>\r\n<p>William  Kelley Eidem is the author of <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Raquel  Sanchez, M.D., had this to say about <em>The  Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em>:<br /> &ldquo;I've read a  lot of books, yet none of them were as clear and interesting as this book. It's  the only one in the last 60 or 70 books that I couldn't put down. With other  books, after a half-hour I'm bored with them. <em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em> is written in a way so you understand  everything perfectly as you read it - nobody writes like that!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n<!---->\n\n<div class=\"visible-sm-block visible-xs-block\">\n<h4 class=\"rel-headline\">Related Stories</h4>\n\n  \n    \n      <h4 class=\"rel-cat\">Cancer</h4>\n      \n      <a href=\"/news/mammography-versus-thermography-cancer/\"><h5>Mammography versus Thermography for Breast Cancer Detection</h5></a>\n\n        \n      <a href=\"/news/anti-cancer-effects-found-onions/\"><h5>Anti-Cancer Effects Found in Onions</h5></a>\n\n        \n      <a href=\"/news/health-perils-night-shift-work/\"><h5>Health Perils of Night-Shift Work</h5></a>\n\n        \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      <h4 class=\"rel-cat\">Dietary Supplementation</h4>\n      \n        <a href=\"/news/battle-flu-colds-bacteria/\"><h5>Battle Flu &amp;

The team analyzed data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a nationwide US study involving 3,000 men and women, ages 57 to 85 years.  They arrived at three key findings regarding the relationships between health and different types of isolation:\n<br><br>\n&bull; The researchers found that the most socially connected older adults are three times as likely to report very good or excellent health compared to those who are least connected, regardless of whether they feel isolated.\n<br><br>\n&bull; The team found that older adults who feel least isolated are five times as likely to report very good or excellent health as those who feel most isolated, regardless of their actual level of social connectedness. \n<br><br>\n&bull; They determined that social disconnectedness is not related to mental health unless it brings feelings of loneliness and isolation. \n<br><br>Separately, Rush University Medical Center (Illinois, USA) researchers studied 906 older men and women, testing their motor functions (including grip, pinch strength, balance, and walking) and surveying their social activity, for a period of 5 years.  Those study participants with less social activity were found to have a more rapid rate of motor function decline. Specifically, the team found that every one-point decrease in social activity corresponded to an increase in functional aging of 5 years, translating to a 40% higher risk of death and 65% higher risk of disability.\n<br><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;
