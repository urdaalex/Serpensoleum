I tried Kangen water so as to not hurt a friend&#8217;s feelings. After 2 weeks I lost 10 lbs and had absolutely no desire to drink diet sodas (which I normally would consume 2 or more a day). I then took it more seriously and adjusted my diet without the usual cravings of previous diets. After 7 weeks I have lost 24 lbs and my osteoarthritis has all but disappeared (without taking the high dosage prescription medications I was on for years). So say what you want but for me proof is in the pudding&#8230;&#8230;it has far exceeded any &#8220;Western Medicine&#8221; remedies I had tried in the past.

She doesn&#8217;t use computers and so I am relaying her story for her. When she was diagnosed with cancer 5 years ago, she did everything the doctors told her. She did chemo and radiation therapy and underwent an operation to remove the tumor. All seemed fine for 3 1/2 years, then her cancer returned (only worse this time). The doctors had no new treatments (just repeats of the old ones), so Ellen decided to do her own research. That&#8217;s where she found out about water ionization. She purchased a water ionizer and began drinking ionized water. It&#8217;s over a year later and her latest checkup reveals NO cancer. She continues to drink alkaline ionized water, but now she has decided to join me as an affiliate and FIGHT CANCER for everyone by bringing the news of water ionizers to everyone she knows. Her strength, health, and vitality has returned to her. Her happiness and hope have returned. She manages a 5-acre farm and still has time to bring friends and family gallon jugs of ionized water to drink (until they can afford to get their own water ionizer). Someday soon, I&#8217;m going to get her to tell her own story in her own words, but for now I thought this was just too good of a story to leave unpublicized. &#8230;Cathie</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070656\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Prostate Cancer</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>\u201c Don &amp; I are in our 80\u2019s and have lived in Washington for our entire lives.\u00a0 My husband was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and we were told he didn\u2019t have much time.

We sold our home &amp; property where we had lived for 50 yrs, as we wanted to downsize in preparation for the inevitable.\u00a0 \u00a0The Doctors gave Don radiation tablets but things didn\u2019t look good and we weren\u2019t hopeful. \u00a0Just before Christmas time 2008, Cheryel told us about this water thing. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t remember much of the conversation other than she had been going through chemotherapy herself, and she kept talking about this water that she swears by.</p>\n<p>We were interested in Cheryel\u2019s story, but Don was feeling poorly as he was having a hard time with his kidneys and we had to leave.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t think about the conversation again, as we were preoccupied.\u00a0 However my nephew showed up at our house one day shortly after Christmas with this a water ionizer that Cheryel had loaned to us.\u00a0 She thought it might make Don feel a little bit better at the very least.</p>\n<p>Don has been drinking the water ever since.\u00a0 When Don started drinking the water his PSA was 253.\u00a0 When we last saw the oncologist at the end of April 2009, Don\u2019s PSA had dropped down to 1.1 and has remained at low cancer free levels ever since.\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019s kidney\u2019s continue to get better.</p>\n<p>We haven\u2019t made too many changes other than drinking the water and eating a bit better.\u00a0 I can\u2019t think of anything besides the water that helped Don.\u00a0 Whatever that water does, we love it and think everyone should drink it.\u00a0 Don &amp; I want to thank Cheryel</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070736\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Arthritis and Fibrobyalgia</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>Kangen water has changed my life.

We found the Bathurst water supply had a consistent pH reading of 7, so we started off on the lower setting, drinking alkaline water with a pH of 8. We then progressed to the higher settings and have been consuming pH 9 ever since.</p>\n<p>Prior to Ionized water I had aches and pains in my knees which I suspected to be ligament or cartilage damage after a long sporting life. This eventually dissipated and when I visited my Naturopath yesterday he confirmed, via his computer iridology scan, there was no longer any visual signs of uric acid in the body. It&#8217;s great to be able to run up and down stairs again without hindrance. He also showed me the fibers in my eyes controlling my kidneys had improved, and these were more clearly defined, indicating better organ functioning. I advised him my candida had also improved and he confirmed this by showing me that the discolored spots (mucus) around my eyes had lightened since my previous scan.<br />\nMy wife Rhonda had suffered from indigestion for many years before drinking the alkaline water. Her digestive system has improved and she is no longer dependent upon Bi-Carb Soda or Enos for relief. She has also noticed improvement to her knees (also problems due to sport) and we have both lost about 5k in 5 months, mainly around our waistlines. We found a glass of water quickly suppressed the appetite and stopped us snacking on inappropriate food between meals. The antioxidant water has proved very addictive and it made us crave for more. Rhonda recently commented that we haven&#8217;t had the dreaded hay fever this year (first time for 20 years), thus no drugs have been required for relief.<br />\nAfter recently completing a course of external chemotherapy (Efudix) to treat skin cancers, I found the healing process to repair the skin more rapid, after treating my internal system with the alkaline water (antioxidants), and my external body with the acid water (astringent).<br />\nWe have also been using the acid water on our garden and indoor plants. As the Bathurst climate is very extreme it is difficult to grow azaleas, but the acid water is doing the trick. Our indoor peace lilies have bloomed for the second time in six months, (an annual occurrence only prior to Jupiter watering). The acid water is also proving a good pesticide for the vegie garden, eliminating the use of those nasty chemicals, which previously found their way into our bodies and did untold damage.<br />\nWe say, God Bless those who help themselves to better health by being water wise(r).&#8221;<br />\nBob &amp; Rhonda Henry, Bathurst</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070356\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Diabetes</span></h2>\n<div>My wife of 75 years young has had the following improvements with in two weeks of drinking Kangen ionized water. Clarity of mind. That right. She could not go shopping without a shopping list or she would not remember what was on the list. Well she went shopping and left the list at home and remembered all 6 items. That may not sound like a lot but perhaps there are some people out there that can appreciate how big that is. Much more energy. Digging in the yard which she would not even think of doing before we got the Kangen water processor. Ok Now my friend who I give the water for free has diabetes and has been on the water for 2 weeks called me today and told his blood sugar went as low as 86.

At my age I have come to expect that getting up in the morning is a chore and that energy is not something I have a great deal of. I am also aware that my memory has been going from bad to worse. My kids call it my &#8220;Whatchmacallit&#8221; syndrome as my sentences slowly fill up with forgotten words.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">It&#8217;s only been a month since I began ionizer water, but the changes have been profound. I walked from home to the beach, 2 kilometers along the beach, and up about 60 steps to a lookout. My kids were amazed, but I didn\u2019t even think about it. The energy was just there!</p>\n<p>I have had a recurrent eye infection for a long time and it has cleared up. My inflamed gum, another long term problem, has also greatly improved, and my tinea is undergoing its own &#8220;healing crisis&#8221; and appears to be drying out from underneath the skin, my kids tell me, is much, much better, and that\u2019s a wonderful thing for me, having seen my sister succumb to Dementia. I am more aware of my food. I am aware of my choices and have stopped the &#8220;hungry ghosts&#8221; ~ my need to nibble. I believe that the way the ionizer reduces the molecule size of the water has helped my brain to re-hydrate. So many older people drink far too little.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">I read about a doctor specialist in Geriatrics who healed his patients through getting them to drink water. That\u2019s true, but the water most of us drink, even filtered water, is nothing like as easy to drink as ionizer water. I drink it and love to drink it. It restored my \u2018natural\u2019 thirst, and I only realized I had lost it when it came back. I think as a nation we are all dehydrated and all acidic overloaded. If this water was available through our taps this country would be a very different, healthier one than what it is today.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Barbara Bond, Byron Bay, Australia</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070206\"></div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070184\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p align=\"left\">I have had chronic fatigue syndrome since 1991.\u00a0 Alkaline\u00a0water\u00a0has given\u00a0me the energy to\u00a0go back to work fulltime. &#8230;Wendy Bosch</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070260\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Energy</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>Do water ionizers really help give you more energy?</p>\n<p>I just take it for granted that I have lots of energy, but every so often I&#8217;ll hear a water ionizer story that reminds me I wasn&#8217;t always this energetic.</p>\n<p>Today, I was talking to one of my customers, and she told me how, since she&#8217;s had her new water ionizer, she feels great now during her workouts.

We have become more regular in our bowel movement. Our bodies have been releasing toxins through flatulation and through excessive urination.</p>\n<p>We have also been using the acid water, which has cleared up dandruff.

The difference is that the medicines can only be applied to each individual case. Whereas ionized water can be consumed generally, and its neutralizing power is something which is very much unexpected. Now, in brief, let me introduce to you a heart disease case and how it was cured.<br />\nThe patient was a 35 year old male suffering from vascular heart disease. For 5 years, his sickness deteriorated. He was in the Setagays Government Hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p>During those 5 years, he had been in and out of the hospital 5 to 6 times. He had undergone high tech examinations such as angiogram by injecting VINYL via the vein into the heart. He consulted and sought treatment from many good doctors. Later he underwent a major surgical operation. Upon his discharge from the hospital, he quit his job to convalesce. However, each time when his illness relapsed, the attack seemed to be even more severe. Last year, in August, his relatives were in despair and expected he would not live much longer. It so happened at that time that the victim&#8217;s relative came across an ionized water processor. His illness responded well and he is now on the road to recovery.</p>\n<p>Note: In the United States cardiovascular diseases account for more than one-half of the approximate 2 million deaths occurring each year. It is estimated that optimal conditioning of drinking water could reduce this cardiovascular disease mortality rate by as much as 15 percent in the United States (From: Report of the Safe Drinking Water committee of the National Academy of Sciences, 1977)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070146\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Gout and pigmentation</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>My daughter came home from a trip in the U.S. and told me to find out more about the alkaline ionic water processor which gives pollutants free water yet has all its minerals unlike the distilled water. I began to read up on the goodness of alkaline ionic water, the different kinds of water filters and processors and the types of water they produce.</p>\n<p>In the first few months of drinking this water, I was pleasantly surprised that I did not experience any gout attacks, even minor ones. I don&#8217;t know when I started to have gout till about 4 years ago. I had my first severe gout attack. I began to experience more and more frequent attacks till in 1998 when just eating a piece of bean curd or drinking a small bowl of meat soup would give me a very painful gout attack. I needed 5 full doses of injections to relieve the pain.</p>\n<p>Now, it is more than a year since I started drinking the water and I have not had a single gout attack.</p>\n<p>Last but not least and it would not be fair if I do not mention here about the comments made by my husband and my friends that the dark patches of pigmentation on my face have shrinkened and lightened tremendously.</p>\n<p>I hope you are encouraged by my testimony and start trying for yourselves if you have the same problem.<em> Mrs. Ann M E Lee, a retired teacher</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070348\"></div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070330\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Arthritis</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>\u201cI contacted a mild case of the E-coli infection five years ago when I was 58 years old. Despite being a mild case, the effects were anything but mild. An 18 month saga of distress began with an emergency room visit, prescriptions that relieved the severe pain but created digestive problems, and eventually ended with my trusted naturopath helping me return to health. Unfortunately, due to the prolonged period of inactivity, arthritis had really taken its toll on me. I suffered from painful arthritis in my hips, neck, shoulders, and ankles. While arthritis is not life threatening, is sure is a pain in the\u2026.well, just about everywhere. Even the simple things that we take for granted like walking up and down stairs were a real problem. I was becoming an old lady, which was not sitting well with me.</p>\n<p>One day a friend of mine told me that I should start drinking ionized water, as the water had helped him with his arthritis. I was skeptical, but I couldn\u2019t deny the success that he had found with the water, so I decided to give it a try. Imagine my surprise when I started to feel better. It got to the point that I actually returned to my Aquafit classes in the local swimming pool. As time progressed, my mobility and flexibility returned. Now I can do squats, which I never thought I would be able to do again. Walking for extended periods used to hurt my feet and cause my ankles to swell, but I recently walked two long trails in Algonquin Park without any pain and zero swelling.</p>\n<p>There are also other subtle but significant effects such as: I can now take my rings off at night, my joints have stopped creaking and cracking and are much more flexible, my abdominal discomfort has disappeared, I sleep much better, I have more energy, and my concentration has improved. Now I can move around like the old days, and having flexible joints has allowed me to return to my passion for quilting. It gets even better. My acid reflux disappeared, I began to lose weight, and my Type 2 diabetes is now under control. It all may sound too good to be true, but every word is the truth. I would be happy to speak to anyone about my experience.\u201d&#8230;.A Canadian Friend</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070924\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Muscular Pain</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>&#8220;For years I suffered uncomfortable rheumatic muscular aches / pains and digestive problems.

I never fell but there were plenty of times that I thought I would.<br />\nOnce I began to drink ionized water, I noticed positive changes. It was hard for me to believe, because I have had the disease for so long, but my symptoms began to improve. I finished the bowling season in May, and my ability to move around with confidence improved each week. My score didn\u2019t improve much, but my enjoyment of the game increased. I found myself able to move to the ball return and deliver the ball with confidence. That may not sound like a big thing to people who don\u2019t suffer from Parkinson\u2019s, but it made a huge difference to me.<br />\nI recently purchased my own water ionizer for convenience, and to take advantage of the water being as fresh as possible. It is important to drink the water fresh, as the ORP is the most effective when the water first comes out of the machine. You learn this stuff as you go.<br />\nRecently I visited my doctor at the University of Miami. I told him of the positive developments once I started drinking the water. He told me that if I wasn\u2019t his patient, he would have a hard time diagnosing me with Parkinson\u2019s. He said that I was certainly no longer the typical Parkinson\u2019s patient. He requested that I send him a link about the water and of course I obliged.<br />\nEvery day I seem to be improving. My hope in sharing this letter is that others may experience similar improvements, and of their symptoms and the quality of life for them will improve like mine.</em></div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070190\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Dry Skin</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>After drinking Alkaline Water for 3 months, my husband was free from gout and no longer depends on medication. As for myself, beside relief from the hassle of boiling water, I was pleasantly surprised by the hydration level of the alkaline water my body experienced.

The exact causes of eczema are not fully understood. In many cases, eczema can be attributed to external irritants</p>\n<p>Let me introduce a patient who recovered from skin disease after consuming the ionized water. This patient suffered 10 years of eczema and could not be cured effectively even under specialist treatment. This patient, who is 70 years of age, is the President of a vehicle parts company. After the war, his lower limbs suffered acute eczema, which later became chronic. He was repeatedly treated in a specialist skin hospital.</p>\n<p>The left limb responded well to treatment, but not so the right limb. He suffered severe itchiness, which, when scratched, led to bleeding. During the last 10 years, he was seen and treated by many doctors. When I first examined him, his lower limb around the joints was covered with vesicles. Weeping occurred owing to serum exuding from the vesicles.</p>\n<p>I advised him to try consuming ionized water. He bought a unit and consumed the ionized water religiously and used the acidic water to bathe the affected areas. After 2 weeks of treatment the vesicles dried up. The eczema was completely cleared without any relapse after 1 1/2 months &#8230;.Prof. Tamura Tatsuji, Keifuku Rehabilitation Center</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070212\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Bowels and Skin</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>My mom just recently bought the Kangen filter machine. I thought it was a waste of money and didn&#8217;t really believe in it either. However, it seems to have had a noticeable effect on my mom. She&#8217;s always had trouble &#8220;going to the bathroom&#8221;&#8221; and constipation, but after drinking the Kangen water she&#8217;s been going to the bathroom normally and her &#8220;wastes&#8221; look/feel more normal. She also sprays the water on her face everyday and her skin does seem to glow more and her freckles are less noticeable&#8230;.Angie, Colorado</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070244\"></div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070236\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Foot Ulcer</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>&#8220;I had a small toe on my left foot that had turned black down to the 1st joint and had to be removed. While in the hospital an ulcer on the ball of my big toe had formed. The doctor decided that if it were removed he could stitch up the area in order for it to heal itself. After many surgeries in an attempt to get the ulcer to heal, nothing seemed to make any improvement.</p>\n<p>A while later a visiting nurse recommended a wound vacuum to be placed on the ulcer in an attempt to keep the area dry. This procedure went on for 2 1/2 months with no change at all. My surgeon abandoned the vacuum treatment and then wanted to stitch up the bottom of my foot again. I didn&#8217;t want to go through with this process again. This is because it hadn&#8217;t worked before and I had great doubts as to whether it would work this time as well.</p>\n<p>I began to talk to a Doctor in Springfield who had high hopes for me. From his conversation and the tests he would perform he thought I might get some much-needed relief from having to bandage this wound everyday. I was very disappointed to find out he was going down the same path as my previous surgeon not to mention I wasn&#8217;t getting any results from the tests he had ordered either.</p>\n<p>Springfield and never looked back. I told my wife I was going home and soak my feet in this pH water [acid] that my brother Jerry had gotten from you. I hoped this was going to work like he had heard it would from others. To be honest with you, I had my doubts but decided to give the water a try anyway.</p>\n<p>I warmed the water up and soaked my left foot in it for about 45-60 minutes. I then allowed my foot to air dry and bandaged it. After doing this procedure for 3 days (December 21-24) on Christmas Eve I changed the bandage. To my surprise I noticed that the wound was healed over and the area was firm to the touch. I couldn&#8217;t believe it at first and called to my wife to come have a look to confirm what I was seeing. My wife had the same reaction that I had; she couldn&#8217;t believe it was finally healed!</p>\n<p>It has been almost exactly 1 year to date since the ulcer appeared, which has caused me to miss work for 6 months straight, not to mention all the money that was lost in wages. I can&#8217;t begin to tell you what this healing pH miracle water has done for me. It has given me restored faith in God and his healing.

After medications with no results, the doctors decided that it should be removed. I was scheduled for operation in 2 weeks. Thats was when a friend told me about Kangen water. He gave me a couple of gallons and asked me to finish it as fast as I can. I normally drink 10 glasses of water so it was not a problem. Eleven days after my kidneys did not hurt as much as it did before. Going to the doctor for pre-operative checkup, he said that there has been a marked improvement and postponed my operation for 1 week.

I took all kinds of nutritional supplements, but still had allergies, post-nasal-drip and periodic illnesses. Then\u00a0I found\u00a0 water ionizers! It has to be the best nutritional-related thing I&#8217;ve ever done! Actually, nothing in the past 36 years of research and investigation into nutrition and natural healing has come close to this in simplicity and truth\u2026in what your body needs to be healthy [in a basic nutritional sense].</p>\n<p>The reason ionized water helps you nutritionally has to do with the acid/alkaline pH balance in your blood, tissues &amp; cells. When you&#8217;re acidic (which almost everyone is in the US) your cells can&#8217;t get rid of their acid wastes &amp; so these build up in the cells, organs &amp; tissues. The older you are the more acidic you become. Ionized water helps re-establish the pH balance you had as a child. Actually even better.</p>\n<p><strong>Germs, cancers, funguses &amp; viruses need acidity to thrive. Only the healthy cells thrive in the correct pH environment. </strong></p>\n<p>Alkaline ionized water is the easiest, most natural way to restore the pH your body needs for health. First of all, you need to drink water, and lots of it, daily. However, you don\u2019t need chlorine, fluoride or any of the other chemicals that are added to your water by your city water company. So a water ionizer filters &amp; eliminates the bad stuff from your water. But beyond that it keeps the alkaline minerals (such as calcium &amp; magnesium) in the water coming out of the top spout (your drinking water) and gets rid of the acidic, poisonous elements (such as fluoride, chlorine, etc.) out of the bottom spout.</p>\n<p>Ionization also puts a negative charge on the water, making it a free-radical scavenger.</p>\n<p>No substances are added to the water, and so there are no side-effects!</p>\n<p>Cathleen LoGrasso</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070592\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Poison Ivy</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>On my leg was a small red, swollen spot where I was hit by a flying pebble while\u00a0trimming my Dad\u2019s lawn edge a\u00a0couple of\u00a0days ago. At night it got itchy an pussy, and it\u00a0seemed to be spreading.\u00a0I got up and took a look at it. It looked like poison ivy got into it somehow. So I soaked it with high alkaline water. The itching and swelling went down. A half\u00a0hour later I soaked it again, and it reduced to a small pink spot with a couple of small scabs on it. It doesn\u2019t itch or bother me at all any more, so I imagine whatever poison was in there is now out and it\u00a0is now\u00a0healing rapidly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070628\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Allergies</span></h2>\n<div>\n<p>Mr. Yamada, the head of Police Research Institute, suffered from severe allergy. He was treated repeatedly by skin specialist, but with no success. Then he started consuming ionized water. The allergy responded very well and was soon completely cured. No relapse had occurred, although he had taken all kinds of food. He was most grateful and excited about this treatment.</p>\n<p>As for myself, I had also suffered severe allergy. Ever since I began to consume ionized water, the allergy has recovered. Since then, I started research on the effectiveness of ionized water.</p>\n<p>I discovered that most allergies are due to acidification of body condition and are also related to consuming too much meat and sugar. In every allergy case, the patient&#8217;s antioxidant minerals are excessively low, which in turn lowers the body resistance significantly. The body becomes overly sensitive and develops allergy easily. To stabilize the sensitivity, calcium solution is injected into the vein. Therefore, it is clear that the ionized water&#8211;that has ionic calcium &#8212; can help alleviate allergy.</p>\n<p>The ionic calcium not only enhances the heart, urination, and neutralization of toxins but controls acidity. It also enhances the digestive system and liver function. It will promote natural healing power and hence increase resistance to allergy. Some special cases of illness, which do not respond to drugs, are found to respond well to ionized water&#8230;.Prof. Kuninaka Hironaga, Head of Kuninaka-Hospital</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pageelement_610070210\">\n<div>\n<h2><span style=\"color:#008080;\">Health</span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>I am never sick since getting the machine, and all my friends and clients love that I share the water with them.

The oldest 2 were in their late teens when we got our first water ionizer. They had allergies, colds, infections, etc. far more than the younger three. As a matter of fact, whenever I saw a cold symptom in the horizon, I&#8217;d get that child some extra water, and continue to get the child to drink extra until the symptom disappeared. The body really will heal itself if you give it the right water. I have had the same results with myself, but the fact that this worked for my whole family is significant in my eyes. &#8230;C.

Many of these patients acknowledged an absolute disdain for drinking water,&#8221; says Dr. Bettiol. &#8220;For those patients who adopted my daily water regimen, an immediate decrease in pain symptomology was observed. That result was too consistent to be a coincidence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dr. Bettiol is determined to continue the work of Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, M.D., who wrote the 1992 best-seller, Your Body&#8217;s many cries for Water. Dr. Batmanghelidj died in 2005, but his signature slogan &#8220;You are not Sick, you are Thirsty&#8212;Don&#8217;t treat thirst with Medications&#8221; lives on. &#8220;Dr. Batmanghelidj warned the public back in the 1980s that America&#8217;s thirst for Soda, Coffee, and Sugar-filled drinks would create a huge population of unhealthy and obese people,&#8221; says Dr. Bettiol. &#8220;To say his prediction was accurate would be a gross understatement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bettiol begins his new journey with the firm opinion that ALL water is not optimum for health. His extensive research has shown that Tap, Bottled, Charcoal-filtered, Distilled and Reverse Osmosis Water is NOT the ideal Water for long-term health and healing. &#8220;America has ignored the miraculous healing being experienced by the Koreans and Japanese with Ionized Alkaline Water,&#8221; says Bettiol. &#8220;Where Bill Gates vision was a computer in every home, my lifetime mission is to get an Alkaline Water Ionizer in every home throughout the world. That would not only eliminate obesity, chronic pain and the need for useless Medication, Surgery &amp; Radiation&#8230;it would single-handedly cut our annual $1.5 Trillion health care costs by 90%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would rather people spend more time with their families, their hobbies and the work they love, than sit in a doctor&#8217;s office for four hours waiting for a
