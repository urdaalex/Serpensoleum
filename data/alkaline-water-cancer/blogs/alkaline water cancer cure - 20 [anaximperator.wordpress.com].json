But the article does no such thing. The article reports fundings to biomedical engineers who are working on <em>a method to measure pH inside cancers</em>.</p>\n<p>Cancers are often more acidic than the rest of the body. How this comes about is described in <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/sugar-depleted-diet-is-not-a-useful-cancer-cure/\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a>. This may influence the efficacy of some types of chemotherapy. And it may also influence the cancers ability to spread.</p>\n<p>There are two paragraphs in the article that may appear to support what the baking soda supporters claim. We will start taking a look at this one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Drinking baking soda has been proven to reduce or eliminate the spread of breast cancer to the lungs, brain and bone, but too much baking soda can also damage normal organs.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-5911\"></span>These are the words of the journalist, not necessarily the words\u00a0of the scientists involved and it may be rooted in the research done by one of the collaborators. The article mentions Ian Robey, assistant professor of research at The University of Arizona Cancer Center. His groups research has<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/tullio-simoncini-and-the-research-that-wasnt/\" target=\"_blank\"> previously been misrepresented</a> by followers of Tullio Simoncini.</p>\n<p>But let us check a out for \u00a0ourselves if it has been <strong>proven</strong> that\u00a0<strong>drinking baking soda</strong>\u00a0reduces or <strong>eliminates</strong> the spread of breast cancer to the lungs, brain and bone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://anaximperator.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mouse.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5931\" src=\"https://anaximperator.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mouse.jpg?w=150&#038;h=105\" alt=\"mouse\" width=\"150\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https://anaximperator.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mouse.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://anaximperator.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mouse.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>Robey and his group looked into what happens when experimental mice implanted with a cancer cell line are fed with sodium bicarbonate. Since mice are not men, one should\u00a0<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/if-it-works-in-a-mouse-it-works-in-a-man-right-well-not-necessarily/\" target=\"_blank\">always be\u00a0cautious</a>\u00a0about concluding directly from such experiments to effects in humans; without experiments in humans it has not been proven to work in humans. However, the results of such experiments can still be informative.</p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/69/6/2260.long\" target=\"_blank\">one research paper</a>\u00a0by Robey&#8217;s group \u00a0that we will take a look at. The main results were:</p>\n<p>1) pH was raised in the tumour stroma, but not inside the tumour cells.<br />\n2) pH was unchanged \u00a0in normal tissue \u00a0(ie. the rest of the body).<br />\n3)\u00a0There were\u00a0fewer metastases\u00a0and they were smaller.<br />\n4) The growth of the primary cancer was unaffected.</p>\n<p>So this study does not prove that <strong>spread is eliminated by drinking baking soda.</strong></p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/11/235\" target=\"_blank\">another interesting paper</a> by Robey&#8217;s group. In this study they looked into DCA and sodium bicarbonate (separately and combined). DCA didn&#8217;t have any effect, but we won&#8217;t go into further details of that aspect of the paper here. Concerning sodium bicarbonate, the main results were:</p>\n<p>1) The growth of the primary cancer was unaffected.<br />\n2) The amount of metastasis were lower in mice treated with sodium bicarbonate. But the difference was too small to rule out that this observation was a play of chance (i.e. not statistically significant).</p>\n<p>So this study does not prove that\u00a0<strong>spread is eliminated by drinking baking soda.</strong> It doesn&#8217;t event prove that metastases are reduced.</p>\n<p>Here is another paragraph in the article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;&#8230;Jennifer Barton, professor and head of UA biomedical engineering. &#8220;Patients can actually change their body&#8217;s pH to make their cancer drugs more effective &#8212; it can be as simple as drinking baking soda &#8212; but this process has to be carefully monitored.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The critical word in that paragraph is<strong> &#8220;body&#8221;</strong>. In various fora where the article is presented as endorsement of Simoncini&#8217;s idea, we are told that a professor says it is easy to increase body pH simply by drinking baking soda.</p>\n<p>The results of the mice experiments mentioned above show something completely different. There was an increase in <strong>tumour</strong> pH, but <em>not</em> of body pH.</p>\n<p>Our guess is that this is a misquote that wasn&#8217;t caught at proof reading. Not only is it inconsistent with Robey&#8217;s results, it is also inconsistent with <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/ph-balance-and-cancer/#more-4028\" target=\"_blank\">what we know</a> about the <a href=\"http://sciencebasedpharmacy.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/your-urine-is-not-a-window-to-your-body-ph-balancing-a-failed-hypothesis/\" target=\"_blank\">normal systems</a> that keep body pH within a very narrow range.We recommend that you follow these links if you want to understand the physiology of pH regulation in the body. But in short &#8211; The body is by nature slightly alkaline with a pH around 7,4. Various regulatory mechanisms in your body work to maintain a stable slightly alkaline pH. This is necessary for the body to function properly.</p>\n<p>So to summarise:</p>\n<p>1) The article is not about clinical trials on sodium bicarbonate as cancer treatment.<br />\n2) An increase in tumour pH does not destroy cancer, but it may enhance effects of chemotherapy.<br />\n3) The best explanation of the statement that drinking baking soda can increase pH of the body, is that it is a typo.<br />\n4) Reduction of amount of new metastasis by drinking baking soda seems like a possibility, but hasn&#8217;t been\u00a0unequivocally proved to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT TO ADD:</strong></p>\n<p><em>The article this post is based on has been corrected.

Jim Kelmun, aka &#8220;Dr. Jim&#8221;, the man who started the baking soda treatment, used it in a different way. You don&#8217;t simply just drink baking soda water, but you have to mix in maple syrup or molasses in with the baking soda. The syrup/molasses attaches itself to the baking soda, allowing it to be absorbed into the tumors. There are many testimonials from many people that this does indeed work. Science will never back it because a box of baking soda on average costs $2.00, while cancer treatments cost tens of thousands of dollars per individual.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-jli9 bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12003\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12003\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8187acdd7dc968290c2344931ab0c7b8?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>JLI</a></cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12003\">September 25, 2013 at 3:35 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><blockquote><p>The syrup/molasses attaches itself to the baking soda, allowing it to be absorbed into the tumors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reality is a bit more complicated than that.

I have had the mole for a few years and it was starting to worry me because of the change in it. I was a bit concerned if it may have been cancerous.<br />\nMy son and sister were the only ones who actually knew I was \u201cexperimenting\u201d and now that it is gone, they weren\u2019t even able to see where the exact spot the mole was located.<br />\nIf it were me, I would drink baking soda / water several times a day if I knew that I had cancer tumors inside of me, as opposed to chemo or radiation for treatment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8212;&gt; I&#8217;m sorry to say this, Kim, but it was a very unwise thing to remove a suspicious looking mole at home. You admit you were concerned it may have been cancerous. Malignant moles, such as melanoma, need to be surgically removed with adequate margins and YET, you may die of the same melanoma within a few years. Now that you&#8217;ve removed the mole, you have no way to prove this way or that. If it hasn&#8217;t grown back yet, it somewhat proves it was not malignant. </p>\n<p>When you DO get real cancer, please let us know how long you stay alive by drinking baking soda and not taking conventional treatments. But before drinking extensive amounts of it, I beg you to look into what it may cause to the rest of your body (the term is alkalosis).

It is scumbags like that who often start such conspiracy rumours, and then explain that they have (and sell) the cure or a book that explains how it is done. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me one bit, if you found your conspiracy theory on such a quack site.</p>\n<blockquote><p> me among!</p></blockquote>\n<p>1) What type of cancer was It ?<br />\n2) How was the cancer diagnosed ?<br />\n3) How was it established that the cancer disappeared?</p>\n<blockquote><p>everybody can see you are a pharma rat </p></blockquote>\n<p>I work as a pathologist in a tax payer financed health care system. I don&#8217;t treat anybody with anything for any condition. My paycheck stays the same regardless of the treatment used. I would love it if easy cheap cures for complicated diseases like cancers existed. It would be good for the patients and it would be good for the budgets. </p>\n<p>It is a shame that people who are dedicated to improve outlooks of cancer patients are being met with contempt because of belief in lunacy: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/dec/07/cancer-conspiracy-theories?fb=optOut\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/dec/07/cancer-conspiracy-theories?fb=optOut</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>i hope you get cancer and die!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope you never get cancer. And I hope that you will never come near anybody diagnosed with cancer. The last thing anyone with cancer needs is advice from someone who uncritically believes in anything that a quackery salesperson says. It is painfully clear that you do not want to understand basic chemistry, basic physiology and basic cancer biology. Taking advice from you on how to treat cancer is downright dangerous.</p>\n<blockquote><p>we do use it and it helped us! so go to hell!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I do not for one second believe that you cured your own cancer by drinking baking soda. But I am willing to reconsider if you can provide proper documentation. If not then we have no choice but to discard your testimonial.

Are you guys know actually what you are talking about???? Correcting the PH level is just for the one reason TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE BODY TO ALKALINE. Like a mold can not live in a dry, cold environment, a cancer can not live in an alkaline environment. Also, to inject cancer cells to a healthy mouse is totally pointless. If the body of the  mouse does not provide an acidic environment, the cancer will not live. It is proven that humans with tumors provide a high acidic environment in the body ( the moist and warm environment the mold needs to grow) if this environment is changed to alkaline, the cancer can not live in the body and the tumor will shrink. This article/case study is a joke. Since 50 years there is a cure for cancer. But the sad thing is that the big business of cancer (the biggest in medicine history) needs every cancer patient to pay for the huge cancer centers and to make good commission at least for 5 years till the person dies because every single organ in the body got fried by chemicals. If you or I would invent a cure from water all these centers would go bankruptcy. </p>\n<p>The medical industry does not want you to wake up &#8211; since 50 years they are doing a perfect job to &#8216;proof&#8217; that people who believe in integrated/alternative medicine are COMPLETE IDIOTS\ud83d\ude42 So&#8230;who is the idiot? The doctors? nope, because they know exactly what they are doing and they know that alternative/integrated treatments do not pay well. Unscrupulousness I guess its the English word for it.

Every cell type in your body can (in principle) develop into its own type of cancer. On top of that individual cancer cells in every cancer are also different from one another. On top of that, the cancer cells interact in very complex ways with the surrounding normal cells. So it is not all that surprising (to me) that we don&#8217;t have, and most likely won\u2019t find a single easy-to-do cure for all cancers.</p>\n<p>That being said, many cancers are cured on a daily basis. Most of them through surgery, but some of them are treated with additional radio-/chemotherapy. And some cancers are cured by chemotherapy alone. Overall cure rate is approximately 60%, so it is more likely that someone diagnosed with cancer will be cured than not. And outlooks are still improving &#8211; all thanks to scientific research.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;.and there is little to be lost in examining novel, non-toxic options.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It can cost the <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/there-is-no-time-to-wait-for-alternative-cancer-therapy-to-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">patient his/her life</a>.

May I compliment you on your improved elocution!</p>\n<p>You argue that the difference between the terms &#8220;cancer&#8221; and &#8220;metastases&#8221; are insignificant because it was not mentioned by nine commenters (not including the moderator and myself). Surely a scientific mind would not assert that this sample represents the entire population of people who read this article (and perhaps wondered how metastases could be reduced while the cancer remained unaffected!)</p>\n<p>I am curious why you are so stuck on the term &#8220;eliminate.&#8221; The fact remains that the reduction in metastases led to increased survival (this is clearly stated in Robey&#8217;s study). How about we look at that? This is good news! This suggests that consumption of bicarbonate may increase survival. Scientific progress, woo-hoo!! Going back to the much-loved term &#8220;eliminate,&#8221; a perusal of the conclusions of Robey&#8217;s study reveals that, while the control group exhibits significant lung lesions in fluorescent imaging, the bicarbonate group demonstrates &#8220;little if any pulmonary fluorescence.&#8221; Huh. Are they saying that the pulmonary lesions are eliminated? Check out figure two. I don&#8217;t see any pulmonary fluorescence in the bicarb group. Do you?</p>\n<p>You suggest that I am misunderstanding the methodology of the procedure in that I believe the metastases are allowed to form before the bicarbonate is administered. Ok. </p>\n<p>Cancer &#8211;&gt; Baking soda (or not) &#8211;&gt; # and size of mets are recorded</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m on board. The # and size of the mets are reduced or eliminated in the bicarbonate group. Yay for scientific progress!</p>\n<p>You claim the cure rate for cancer is 60%. I am glad to hear that, I thought it was much worse. I am curious where you get this information and how one defines &#8220;cure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You say that cancer is a collective term for 200 diseases. I am not sure of the veracity of this statement but I do find it a little odd that we approach 200 different diseases with the same three<br />\ntherapies: chemo, radiation and surgery. Maybe baking soda would work great for one type and vampire toenails for another. Notwithstanding my poor attempts at humor, maybe we could save a few lives.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, I previously mentioned that investigating novel approaches might not be a half-bad idea. Your response is that doing so may cost cancer patients their lives. Hmm. Clinical trials routinely include terminally ill cancer patients who die in spite of their participation. Perhaps some patients would volunteer to participate in trials that do not involve toxic substances being injected into their already ravaged bodies. Or, we can gather further data by using animal subjects, which perhaps could help inform future applications. </p>\n<p>You claim the founder of this blog &#8220;explains very well&#8221; her inspiration for starting it. She does not in fact explain it very well. She was inspired to start it because of two cancer afflicted women she knew pursued unconventional therapies and died. That is all the information we have. I don&#8217;t know what alternative therapies they pursued or if they rigorously adhered to recommended protocols. Surely you&#8217;ll agree that two women who chose alternative cancer treatments and unfortunately died are not representative of the world&#8217;s population of cancer patients who pursue unconventional treatments.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12345\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12345\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0c117e928b36f8221add7cdef12d99f1?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://gravatar.com/bnkazak' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>bnkazak</a></cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12345\">December 16, 2013 at 10:40 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>You write &#8220;Mice are injected with cancer -&gt; Mice are treated with sodium bicarbonate/not treated -&gt; The number and size of metastases are recorded.&#8221;<br />\n========================================<br />\nThe man was not injected &#8211; he GOT cancer.

You can have cancer without metastasis (but not the reverse). You may choose to disagree, and so be it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am curious why you are so stuck on the term \u201celiminate.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>Because that is what a cure aims at. And this is what people are told all over the internet that drinking baking soda can do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This suggests that consumption of bicarbonate may increase survival. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay imagine you have just been diagnosed with cancer, and you are given the following choices:</p>\n<p>1) You may drink baking soda, which has been shown to reduce the rate of metastasisformation in mice, thus possibly prolonging survival compared to doing nothing. However it will not do anything to the (primary) cancer itself.<br />\n2) You can have the conventional treatemnt, which will remove the primary cancer completetly, and with a probability of 60 % you will never experience a recurrence. There is a risk of side effects, but evidence is, that this risk is outweighed by the benefits.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do find it a little odd that we approach 200 different diseases with the same three therapies: chemo, radiation and surgery.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is because you know very little about modern cancer treatment. There are more tretament types than these three (althoug some of the other types resemble chemotherapy). And chemotherapy is not one thing either. I don&#8217;t have the exact number, but there are approximately 100 different chemotherapies. Different types of cancer respond to different types of chemotherapies (if at all). There is great variation in side effects. If you are genuinely interested in knowing the basics of moderne conventional cancer treatment, <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site </a>is recommended.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe baking soda would work great for one type&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oncologists already have experience with sodium bicarbonate. It is useful as treatment of tumour lysis syndrome. When cancer cells have been destroyed, there is a risk that metabolic products of nucleic acids will precipitate in the kidneys. Sodium bicarbonate helps keeping these products dissolved, so that they can be eliminated with the urine. If sodium bicarbonate had an effect on its own on cancer, it would have been known.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps some patients would volunteer to participate in trials that do not involve toxic substances being injected into their already ravaged bodies. </p></blockquote>\n<p>There have indeed been such trials involving substances claimed by the alt med industry to be non-toxic. I&#8217;ll leave it to you to think about why alt med sites do not inform their readres about them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Surely you\u2019ll agree that two women who chose alternative cancer treatments and unfortunately died are not representative of the world\u2019s population of cancer patients who pursue unconventional treatments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sadly they are. This is not only the experience of oncology wards. It is also the findings of follow up studies as explained in a previous comment. It is your choice if you want to believe websites promoting alternative therapy for cancer or websites critical of them.

Can anyone explain why we have so many alternative cures and yet only medical evidence based diagnosis?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12354\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12354\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59c4163c1f4667fe142e605a62f4ce1a?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\">Sarah</cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12354\">December 17, 2013 at 4:16 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Thank you once again for taking the time to respond to my comments. </p>\n<p>You mention that the difference between cancer (I am assuming you refer to the primary tumor) and metastases are insignificant. Yikes. While they are indeed part of the same malignant entity, they are clearly not one and the same. A mass without metastatic potential is relatively innocuous while a mass that is experiencing uncontrolled spread is clearly a deadly threat. You also state that you can have cancer without metastasis but not the reverse. Hmm, let&#8217;s ponder that for a second. A primary cancer can exist without metastases if it has not begun to spread. Right on. Metastases without a primary tumor now&#8230;what about if the primary cancer is surgically removed and metastases/micrometastases remain. Why I do believe this would entail a situation where metastases exist in the absence of a primary tumor.</p>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s revisit the concept of a cancer cure (i.e the &#8220;elimination&#8221; of cancer). This would be great and we would have one in a perfect world. As this is not the world we live in,  let&#8217;s put on our realistic pants and focus on progress in the field of cancer treatment in terms of decreasing or halting metastatic spread without introducing radioactive poisons into the body (fun fact: chemo was developed from chemical warfare!)  If baking soda, essiac, b 17, low dose naltrexone, vitamin c, the budwig protocol, etc. and so forth can do this to any degree, I think we have our selves something to celebrate! And if websites want to proclaim that any of these are THE CURE, we can criticize them but just like it is your prerogative to express your views in this blog, that is their prerogative. Thanks 1st amendment!! My personal concern is not to declare that they are right and you are wrong or vice versa, I am merely trying to arrive at the truth.</p>\n<p>So you propound a hypothetical scenario in which I myself have contracted cancer. My options are a) guzzle baking soda and b) receive conventional treatment (and deal with the side effects like, um, cancer) and party like it&#8217;s 1999 with my buddies in the lucky 60%. Oh, that reminds me, I had asked you where you are getting this number and what our definition of cure is, perhaps you could provide this info?? Anyway, back to my cancer\ud83d\ude26. Well I guess I would have that bad boy surgically removed and then toast the new millennium with a yummy baking soda spiked beverage!</p>\n<p>You state that I know little about modern cancer treatment. You may be correct in this regard, although the consensus seems to be that it blows.  I do think it&#8217;s interesting that you distinguish between 200 different kinds of cancer and 100 different kinds of cancer treatment. So in my hypothetical first-hand experience, I am not going to get cancer and receive chemo/radiation, I am going to get cancer and receive chemo/radiation. Whew, I was scared for a second there.</p>\n<p>So thanks for referring me to Cancer Research UK. I am actually interested in cancer treatments in the US, as I am not a mouse in Britain. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, you also mention that there have been trials which assess the efficacy of non-toxic potential cancer treatments and you imply that &#8220;altie&#8221; websites omit mention of these. You suggest that I contemplate why this is the case. Having experienced a great deal of mental strain in this attempt, perhaps you could refer me to the studies themselves. Thanks. Hey, did you get a chance to check out Figure 2 in Robey&#8217;s study? I put my glasses on and still couldn&#8217;t see anything. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>So, in conclusion, I am really glad I have stumbled across your blog, I have found it very interesting and look forward to reading more of your articles. I did want to mention that the the subtitle of your blog, &#8220;blogging against alternative treatments&#8221; may be a bit misleading. If, hypothetically, some smarty-pants unaffiliated scientist were to come across a viable, unpatentable, effective treatment for cancer which would by definition be &#8220;alternative&#8221; until it was accepted by the medical community, you wouldn&#8217;t want to blog against that. Now would you?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-jli9 bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12356\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12356\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8187acdd7dc968290c2344931ab0c7b8?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>JLI</a></cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12356\">December 17, 2013 at 4:27 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Sorry to hear about your friend.</p>\n<p>Youtube videos can be very persuasive &#8211; in particular those with testimonials. As <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained above</a>, there are several things that can be wrong with testimonials. For example it can be very difficult to spot, that the patients in the Rick Simpson video (Which I assume was the one your friend found) also had conventional treatment.</p>\n<p>Other convincers are results of laboratory experiments. There have been conflicting results from studies on cancer cell lines cultured in dishes or implanted in experimental genetically modified mice. Cancer in a patient is not the same as a cancer cell line grown in a dish or implanted in a mouse.

It wasn&#8217;t a controlled study, so we can&#8217;t know if the benefits that were observed was an effect of cannabis or an effect of the natural history of their cancer. The bottom line is, that all nine patients died within a year. Not a single patient was cured.</p>\n<p>There are currently ongoing clinical trials that aim at answering if Cannabis will be useful as part of treatment of some cancers. The fact that anti-cancer capabilities of cannabis is being researched proves that it is not being suppressed. <a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2012/07/25/cannabis-cannabinoids-and-cancer-the-evidence-so-far/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a balanced, honest and up to date review</a> of the results of cannabis research, and the conclusions that can be drawn from it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-jli9 bypostauthor even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12357\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12357\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8187acdd7dc968290c2344931ab0c7b8?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>JLI</a></cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12357\">December 17, 2013 at 8:21 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><blockquote><p>Thank you once again for taking the time to respond to my comments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well &#8211; This will be the last time.

Surgery is the most important part of the treatment &#8211; Perhaps the only one needed. In the adjuvant setting (given in addition to the surgery) the contribution of chemotherapy to survival is highly variable &#8211; and is certainly not given to all patients.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am actually interested in cancer treatments in the US, as I am not a mouse in Britain.

I am sure there are reader friendly American websites about cancer too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>perhaps you could refer me to the studies themselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I suppose I could list a few examples:<br />\n<a href=\"http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/12/2058.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pancreatic proteolytic enzyme therapy</a> (Gonzales)<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104253241706#t=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerson therapy</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106659?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;ordinalpos=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;B17&#8221; &#8211; A review of 36 clinical trials.</a> The library may be able to get it for you for free.<br />\n<a href=\"http://dca-information.pbworks.com/f/Metabolic%20Modulation%20of%20Glioblastoma%20with%20Dichloroacetate.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DCA</a> And <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/17/dichloroacetate-dca-and-cancer-deja-vu-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> is a fairly detailed analysis of that study.<br />\n<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.21107/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shark cartilage</a></p>\n<p>These are only a few examples. There is a lot of evidence of absence out there.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hey, did you get a chance to check out Figure 2 in Robey\u2019s study</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes- but I think the rest of the article is far more interesting: The report of fewer and smaller metastases in the sodium bicarbonate group. The figure shows fluorescence photos of 5 treated with sodium bicarbonate without fluorescence, and 5 untreated with varying degrees of fluorescence. In the other article there is a fluorescence photo of a lung metastastasis from a sodium bicarbonate treated mouse resembling one of the untreated mice in fig.2.</p>\n<blockquote><p> I have found it very interesting and look forward to reading more of your articles</p></blockquote>\n<p>You are welcome, but as I stated above, I have no more time to argue over semantics with you.</p>\n<blockquote><p>smarty-pants unaffiliated scientist were to come across a viable, unpatentable, effective treatment for cancer which would by definition be \u201calternative\u201d until it was accepted</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not necessarily. There are interesting ideas, and then there are crackpot ideas that are dismissble right away. I know it can be difficult to understand how we can know that crackpot ideas are what they are. I can try and illustrate it with an analogy I think you can follow:</p>\n<p>Someone launches an idea that it is not the heart that is responsible for blood circulation. It is the liver. Circulatory disturbances are easily cured by not drinking alcohol &#8211; and it is all described in a book that you can buy over the internet. The big pharmers try to suppress this information (alcohol is basically an agricultural product). Advocates of this nonsense will persuade people into not taking their heart medication.</p>\n<p>To people who understand cancer biology, this example is no more absurd than many cancer crackpot ideas.<br />\nIf you are interested in how and why new treatments should be tested, I can <a href=\"http://www.testingtreatments.org/the-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">recommend this freely downloadable book</a>. It is not about alternative therapy.

First, let me apologize. I am indeed a flawed individual as you point out. I appreciate you trying to provide some insight into my psyche, but my last eval didn&#8217;t mention anything about a persecution complex&#8230;<br />\nI kid! I struggle with sarcasm (total defense mechanism) and I am trying to work on this, so please bear with me if I slip here and there.<br />\nIn all seriousness, I harbor no ill will towards you and quite enjoy our animated tete-e-tetes. I admire your convictions but I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with some of them. Further, I do not randomly take up causes (although it is much more fun than I would&#8217;ve thought! sorry&#8230; slip) I am just a person concerned about someone who has cancer and took the trouble to look into the facts.<br />\nSo, having said that, I do have have a background in science and I am able to independently investigate your assertions (this is how I found out what a persecution complex is hee-hee). Now I myself enjoy reading scholarly scientific articles from time to time, but I could totally see someone wanting to pursue more stimulating activities, say, staring at a wall.<br />\nSo, in essence, someone may be looking to you as an &#8220;expert&#8221; to interpret this snooze-inducing data. So it is not really me that I am worried about, it is the people that may not question your biased or straight-up wrong commentary.<br />\nLet&#8217;s take an example. If I recall correctly, we were discussing the significance of the fluorescent imaging in Robey&#8217;s initial study involving bicarbonate (NOT the other one which I know you like to bring up). Let&#8217;s break it down:</p>\n<p>Fluorescence=cancer<br />\nNo fluorescence=no cancer</p>\n<p>Kapisch? </p>\n<p>No bicarbonate=fluorescence=cancer</p>\n<p>Yes bicarbonate=no fluorescence=(drum roll please)=no cancer!!!</p>\n<p>This, again, is illustrated in figure two and refers to pulmonary findings only. So again, to simplify again:</p>\n<p>Yes carbonate=no cancer</p>\n<p>See? I just don&#8217;t want anybody to be confused about the study or it&#8217;s findings, so I am trying to be as clear as possible.<br />\nAnd yes, I have agreed with you in some instances. I do not think you are 100% wrong, nor do I think I am 100% right (or vice versa). But you seem to think I am 100% wrong 100% of the time even when I am calling a duck a duck (see example above).</p>\n<p>I am very glad that you don&#8217;t dislike me and we are working things out.

The photos shown in the article are compressed versions of photos used for data analysis. Try and compare file size to the photos in the article with the file size in a photo taken with your own digital camera. In this type of experiments file size matters, because \u201cfusion of pixels\u201d can obscure smaller details. So no visible fluorescence in the photo in the article may very well mean very little fluorescence in the microscope/original image used for image analysis.</p>\n<p>This is what is shown in figure 3A.

If I had a lymphoma or testicular cancer (presuming of course, that I was appropriately endowed), I would probably make the same choice. Should the winds of fate blow some other cancer my way, however, I would seriously consider my options. Our fundamental disagreement, l think lies in the ostensible degree of efficacy of baking soda versus chemotherapy.

I am under no delusions about the efficacy of chemotherapy (or lack thereof). Just like any other business, the pharmaceutical companies operate in their own best financial interests, incentivizing the overuse of chemotherapy. As you probably know, oncologists receive a huge kickback for prescribing chemotherapy, essentially buying at wholesale prices and selling at retail.

An <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/only-3-percent-survive-chemotherapy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis of this study</a> is one of the most read posts on this blog. Others have <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/09/16/two-percent-gambit-chemotherapy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogged about it</a> too.<br />\nTo summarise a few important points:<br />\nChemotherapy may be used in the following situations:<br />\n1) As the only treatment: Chemotherapy contributes 100% to survival<br />\n2) As an addition to surgery. Contribution to survival is highly variable (a few percents or maybe as high as 30%)<br />\n3) To relieve symptoms in highly advanced cancers. Chemotherapy contributes 0% to survival.<br />\nSo depending on how you select the groups you analyze, you can get anything from 0% to 100% contribution to survival.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, if someone kicks the cancer bucket at 5 years and one day, they are considered a success story.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is a bit more complicated than that. The longer time that passes without a recurrence, the greater likelihood that the patient will never experience a recurrence. For some cancers, the 5 year survival rate is a relevant (but not perfect) measure of success. For others it is not a good measure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019d rather take my chances with Arm and Hammer and keep my dignity and self-respect.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is what Big Altie wants you to believe is a good idea. They earn big money too remember. And in the context of cancer they do so by scaring people away from conventional treatment. And persuasively claim that they have an-easy-to-do-highly-effective-cure.</p>\n<blockquote><p> As you probably know, oncologists receive a huge kickback for prescribing chemotherapy, essentially buying at wholesale prices and selling at retail.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not in my country. As a pathologist I participate in multidisciplinary cancer conferences. We discuss each and every patient. Chemotherapy isn\u2019t given nilly willy. We assess carefully if chemotherapy is relevant in each and every case (ie if the benefits are greater than side effects). Oncologists actually spend quite some time with patients explaining to them why chemotherapy should not be given in individual cases.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You mention acquaintances that have not found chemotherapy to be particularly unpleasant. a) these experiences are quite subjective and b) you yourself essentially dismiss any \u201ctestimonial\u201d as lacking credibility. Further, I omitted an extensive list of possible side effects in my previous comment; lung damage, heart failure and death are not \u201ctransient.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Side effects occur. Even serious side effects. It is important not to confuse deaths due to adverse events with preventable deaths. For example, failing to treat curable cancers with chemotherapy would reduce the number of deaths due to complications of chemotherapy. But the number of deaths due to cancer would rise, and those people who did not die from a chemotherapy related complication will still die.</p>\n<blockquote><p> In most cases, it does not cure cancer as it does not address the root causes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Beatis came up with this analogy: There are lots of things you can do to prevent a fire in your house. But if the fire breaks out, none of this will put it out. You need to do something more drastic. Similarly you can\u2019t cure a cancer by stopping to do something that can cause it. Besides cancer isn&#8217;t caused by sodium bicarbonate deficiency, so it doesn&#8217;t address the root cause either.</p>\n<blockquote><p> His experience with chemotherapy is not representative of the rest of the population.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an example.Untreated it is universally lethal. 5 year survival rate for children who get ALL is 88%. Chemotherapy contribute 100% to the 88% 5 year survival rate.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You claim adjuvant therapy can improve survivorship. How are we to know whether or not survival is attributable solely to surgery?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We can\u2019t on an individual basis, but we can by collecting data on large number of patients. Let\u2019s take a concrete example. A 60 year old in average health for her age diagnosed with a grade 2 Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer measuring 3.5 cm. And with metastasis to 5 lymph nodes. In this situation statistics say that  48.3 patients will still be alive in 10 years after surgery, 42.6 will have died of cancer, and 9.1% will have died of unrelated conditions. If hormonal therapy and modern chemotherapy is given 69,4 % will be alive after 10 years. So adding hormone an chemotherapy to surgery results in an improved 10 year survival of 21.1%. The contribution of hormone/chemotherapy to 10 year survival in this case is 21.1/69.4 = 30.4% (there are also data on hormone therapy alone and chemotherapy alone).<br />\nBut again \u2013 It is not possible to point out on an individual basis which patient in this scenario would have survived for at least 10 years with surgery alone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You state that the chance of recurrence is reduced with time and 5 year survival is indicative of this.

Moreover, survival time also correlates with an increased probability of developing a secondary cancer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the knowledge that having passed the 5 year (or 10 year) mark means that the risk of a recurrence has decreased considerably is a positive thing. The risk of a secondary cancer is certainly there. And this is taken into consideration when deciding if a treatment will be beneficial or not. <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002043-pdf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a document</a> by the American Cancer Society on this.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are always opportunistic people that will exploit the vulnerable for their own financial gain.

I have previously mentioned Mercola and Mike Adams as examples of this, and they are not the only ones.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So if the meta-analysis I referred to in my last comment is not credible, to what shall we refer?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have to accept that cancer biology is very complex.

If I had either of these conditions, I would likely agree to chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>It is the OTHER cancers that I am concerned about, ones in which the use of cytotoxic therapies are more dubious. You mention adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy in the context of breast cancer. Robey&#8217;s study was conducted using this type of malignancy and was found to be effective in reducing and/or eliminating metastases (and prolonging survival) which we have explored ad nauseum. I would be interested in the statistics involving chemo and hormones alone, as this is more relevant than their effect in combination.</p>\n<p>Here is a article regarding the inappropriate use of chemotherapy from a legal perspective. It illustrates a top-down profit motive that clearly overrides any interest in providing patients with optimal care. Pharmaceutical companies have paid out millions in settlements for their corrupt practices. It is absolutely obscene and unconscionable. I am not interested in the likes of Mercola and Mike Adams. These are small-time players whose alleged profit motive is laughable when compared with the despicable greed and corruption that is integral to the pharmaceutical industry structure.</p>\n<p>Here is an interesting study involving the mechanism involved in rendering a cancer less susceptible to chemotherapy:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22863786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22863786/</a></p>\n<p>It is this possibility of chemo-resistance that makes me wary of post-operative adjuvant therapy. If the cancer comes back stronger and yet more virulent after one has dutifully gone through the recommended chemotherapy radiation, what then? Whether it is the recurrence of the same cancer or the induction of a secondary cancer, are we not jumping from the frying pan into the fire?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12415\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12415\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59c4163c1f4667fe142e605a62f4ce1a?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\">Sarah</cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12415\">December 29, 2013 at 5:56 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>My first link seems to be absent in my comment, my apologies.

I am a little disappointed I have not received a response from you yet! Of course, we have had our differences in the past, but I have tried to be as civil as possible and have refrained from being &#8220;personal or offensive.&#8221; I have great respect for this blog in that it allows &#8220;critical or controversial&#8221; commentary, regardless of whether or not it is in accord with the writers&#8217; beliefs. I find it commendable that you consistently stand by your convictions and have always a) printed my comments and b) responded to them in a critical yet objective manner. This has made your position somewhat more credible, at least in my estimation. Simply disregarding a legitimate comment (with compelling data to support it) which may be difficult for you to refute casts great doubt on your credibility and legitimacy. It is my suspicion that the following statement is in part responsible for the lack of response:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The obscene profits made off chemotherapy override any incentive to find a cure or better treatments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I understand that this statement and the article in question may be very challenging for you to discredit. However, if you truly believe what you profess, you will attempt to do so and not simply disregard it. I&#8217;m sure you will agree that a lack of response may be indicative of an erroneous viewpoint and conscious dissemination of false information. I certainly hope this is not the case and look forward to hearing back from you soon.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-beatis even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12445\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12445\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/02e39b84d65c85992ed5b3009851027f?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\">beatis</cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12445\">January 3, 2014 at 5:01 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><blockquote><p>(&#8230;) Another close friend was supposed to die within 3-4 months after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and a tennis sized tumor on his lung, He went with a Rife machine and supplements(ambutose I believe).

I have a family too. So I really can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t devote all my spare time on a computer.</p>\n<p>That a law firm tries to make their opponent stand in as bad a light as possible is not unusual. It is true, that new drugs are often very expensive. It would be refreshing if the regulators would just say no sometimes. They actually did that in the UK a while back. They refused to accept the costs of a new drug that had effect against melanoma. And they succeeded in getting the price down. I&#8217;d love to see more of that.</p>\n<p>But it is not true that these drugs are ineffective. And it is not true that the pharmaceutical companies do not continue to develop new and more effective drugs. </p>\n<p>There are good incentives to want to improve cancer treatments. Owners/employees (And their love ones) of pharmaceutical companies suffer from cancer too. Pharmaceutical companies wouldn&#8217;t lose money for finding a cure or just a major breakthrough &#8211; They would increase their income considerably.</p>\n<p>It is an undeniable fact that outlooks for cancer patients have improved considerably in the last few decades. And it is my prediction that they will continue to do so. You might like to take a look at how <a href=\"http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/childhoodcancer/survival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">progression has been made in the treatment of childhood cancers</a>. Children are not part in screening programs, so what you see is not just a consequence of earlier detection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/10/4/250.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Figure 2 in this article </a>also illustrate this point.</p>\n<p>In the context of having had treatment for cancer James Randi <strong>IS</strong> an ordinary person. That someone tells us that he/she underwent chemotherapy for cancer and found it to be doable is plausible. And it is consistent with what is reported in the scientific literature as well as what other cancer patients say.</p>\n<p>A testimonial of a miraculous cancer cure is a completely different thing. You can compare it to the following:<br />\nIf someone says they have an apple tree in their garden, we have no reason to disbelieve it. Apple trees grow in many peoples gardens &#8211; It is absolutely plausible. If another person says that he/she has a unicorn in the garden, it is fair to meet this person with disbelief. Making us believe this statements requires a completely different level of documentation.</p>\n<p>And a few remarks about having adjuvant chemo therapy and development of resistance. The smaller the number of tumour cells there are, the easier it is for the chemotherapy to mop up them all. The risk of chemoresistance becoming a problem is smaller in the adjuvant setting compared to treatment of a recurrence.</p>\n<p>And then there was the question of chemo/hormone treatment alone in the example mentioned:<br />\nChemotherapy:  10 year survival = 61.8% =&gt;   Contribution of chemotherapy: 21.8%<br />\nHormone therapy: 10 year survival = 58.9% =&gt; Contribution of hormone therapy: 18%</p>\n<p>But the combination is relevant, because this is how patients are treated.</p>\n<p>It is my impression that you think the alt med industry are small players without relevant financial interests. This is demonstrably incorrect. They have managed to prevent legislation they were against by political lobbying, recruitment of celebrities and organizing bullying of opponents. They have managed to ensure a court room decision to let a quack treat a 10 year old by with an early stage lymphoma to death despite three appeals from the authorities (This was back in the 1970&#8217;s, and would probably not happen today). The altmed industry <strong>is</strong> a big money spinner.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"li-comment-12464\">\n\t\t<div id=\"comment-12464\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59c4163c1f4667fe142e605a62f4ce1a?s=40&#038;d=identicon' class='avatar avatar-40' height='40' width='40' /><cite class=\"fn\">Sarah</cite>\t\t\t<a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/research-at-university-of-arizona/#comment-12464\">January 4, 2014 at 6:16 pm</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>@ Beatis- I am the world&#8217;s expert on who I am/am not accusing; you are not.</p>\n<p>@ Beatis and JLI- could you tell me again what these &#8220;newer and better&#8221; treatments are?

It is living 5 years beyond a cancer diagnosis. Sounds pretty good if you&#8217;re attending your 80th or 90th birthday party. But tell the parents of a 2 year old cancer patient that their little peanut has an excellent chance of making it to the ripe old age of 7. What&#8217;s that, parent of 2 year old cancer patient?

This particular discussion would benefit much from not patronizing people with different views (eg &#8220;It\u2019s obvious you are not familiar with chemotherapy&#8221; or &#8220;This is because you know very little about modern cancer treatment. &#8220;). Sarah&#8217;s comments are not pro-alternative, she is just pointing out the reality. Science is fantastic and we, as a humankind, are making constant progress, also in healthcare, thanks to it. I cannot imagine the world without Imatinib. But this is the only miraculous drug, and other chemotherapeutics are not as effective. We still have a long way to go. Also, the research progress in cancer biology/therapy that does not excuse the attacks on &#8220;alternative&#8221; treatments. If proper, scientific research shows something works, why exclude it? The metastasis were smaller and fewer, if that concerned a drug, we would be all happy. Why such opposition? On the other hand, if clinical trials with an &#8220;alternative treatment&#8221; is performed and fails, that should be known and accepted as well.

Now if you lock your door and install an alarm he will have tremendous difficulties to rob you. The same is valid for cancer. </p>\n<p>The only way to prove this wrong is to find a single cancer patient with a PH level above 7! There is none! The same is not valid the way around as you can find many people with a PH under 7 and still with no cancer! The body is fighting for balance all the time day and night, stealing from your calcium reserves if you abused on acidification of your body&#8230;</p>\n<p>BUT. Unfortunately it is not simple to increase your PH above 7. This needs the right products/foods, a lot of time, energy, belief, and above all it needs you to trust in yourself and not be influenced by the medical corpse in whom we too much naturally trust because they studied so long bla bla bla&#8230;</p>\n<p>When we all talk about PH, it makes me worried to see how many people have no clue what they talk about, including professionals here (I am not one of them that is clear right); PH in blood does not change much.

Have you even heard of him yourself ??</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if they have heard about Otto Warburg or not. What matters is if his observations are being taken seriously. And this is actually the case. Anaerobic glycolysis (which really is what the Warburg effect is all about \u2013 but it seems as if you haven\u2019t understood that) is what makes a PET-scan useful in cancer staging. And it is also one of many targets in development of new cancer treatments. If you are truly interested, you can read more about what the Warburg effect is <a href=\"https://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/sugar-depleted-diet-is-not-a-useful-cancer-cure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How many scientific studies have been made about a natural cure costing less than 100$? </p></blockquote>\n<p>Enough to know, that they are useless.</p>\n<blockquote><p>..then if I were a pharmaceutical giant I would finance the scientific study that proves it to be crap. </p></blockquote>\n<p>They don\u2019t need to. If you actually read the post, you will see, that it doesn\u2019t even cure experimental rodents. Such a study would be highly unethical. Besides \u2013 Those who make the calims should be the ones who provide evidence in the form of scientific studies. Testimonials are no such things.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There was no cancer before because there was no pollution, bad foods, soda\u2019s, extreme stress and many more acidifying aspects of our lives!</p></blockquote>\n<p> Cancer has been demonstrated in ancient Egyptian mummies. And also in dinosaur fossils (which were extinct long before mankind had evolved).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is a nobel price and not you and me who has proven cancer can only grow in an acidic environment and cancer can simply not survive in an alkaline environment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once again you demonstrate your lack of understanding of the Warburg effect. I assume that you haven\u2019t read the post I linked to before, and that you have no intention of doing so. So I will just make a short recap for you:</p>\n<p><em>Aerobic glycolysis results in production of excessive acid, which needs to be expelled by the cancer cells if they are to stay alive. Because the blood vessels are incapable of removing the excessive acid at this pace, a small decrease pf pH in the vicinity of the cancer is seen.</em> This acidity facilitates the spread, but it is not a prerequisite for the cancer to survive. This is supported by the experimental evidence presented in this post.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we all talk about PH, it makes me worried to see how many people have no clue what they talk about, </p></blockquote>\n<p>I will respectfully include you in that group. But there is always a chance that you will at least attempt to learn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>including professionals here (I am not one of them that is clear right);</p></blockquote>\n<p>Crystal clear<img width='16' height='16' class='wp-smiley emoji' draggable='false' alt=':mrgreen:' src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/mrgreen.svg' style='height: 1em; max-height: 1em;' /></p>\n<blockquote><p> PH in blood does not change much.

The baking soda and sugar does not have to be &#8220;bonded&#8221; for it to be taken up by the cancer cell. Both will find there way to the cancer cell just fine. You can make the cancer cell more sensitive by lowering or completely cutting out your carb intake so the cancer cell will be more sensitive to a certain medicine or other substance. For example, when you get a Petscan you are told that the night before you should refrain from eating carbohydrates to make the cancer more sensitive to the  fluorodeoxyglucose they inject you with.</p>\n<p> A family member of mine had been using DCA for 6 years and is considered a miracle by her oncologist. Her breast cancer has never gone away but it also has never metastasized either and  she had at one point dozens of tumors before she started using it. In 6 years she has had 3 sessions of chemo. I do not consider DCA a cure but I do think it works and works even better with low dose chemo which has what her Dr has always given her. At her age she can&#8217;t take a full dose and her Dr always say that the dose he uses should even work. I don&#8217;t need any studies or Drs to tell me what works or doesn&#8217;t.

We know that cancer cells use more glucose for their metabolism than normal cells. When you have a pet scan, you are injected with fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG), a very low concentration solution of glucose (sugar molecules) in water. The sugar molecules in the solution have a radioactive isotope of fluorine (hence the &#8220;F&#8221;) attached to them which allows the scanner to \u201csee\u201d where the sugar is being used (metabolized) in your body, which can be a sign of cancer activity. When you eat a lot of carbohydrates before a pet scan, the blood sugar level and sugar metabolism in normal cells will heighten considerably, making them appear like cancer cells. This can can cause &#8220;false positives&#8221; (i.e. normal cells looking like cancer cells), making the scan invalid.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A family member of mine had been using DCA for 6 years and is considered a miracle by her oncologist. Her breast cancer has never gone away but it also has never metastasized either and she had at one point dozens of tumors before she started using it. In 6 years she has had 3 sessions of chemo. (&#8230;) DCA had given her some good quality years. I have also personally seen it work on others too.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wonder why you give no credit at all to the chemotherapy, which has been proven to be effective against cancer, whereas the first proof of the effectiveness of DCA has yet to be delivered.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t need any studies or Drs to tell me what works or doesn\u2019t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, since we&#8217;re not clairvoyant, we do.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</ol>\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"respond\"
