\u00a0It&#8217;s actually pretty simple when you look at what these people claim. \u00a0They claim that they have the cure for cancer, AIDS,\u00a0hepatitis, and many other\u00a0chronic\u00a0diseases. \u00a0How can they claim this? \u00a0Well they rely primarily on the work of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Heinrich_Warburg\">Dr. Otto Warburg</a>. \u00a0Warburg believed that a lack of oxygen in the body&#8217;s tissues was the cause of cancer and that flooding the tissues with oxygen would reverse the growth of tumors. \u00a0Now there are many things that cause cancer, but the key reason cancer cells develop is damage to the dna of the cell, which causes\u00a0uncontrolled\u00a0cellular reproduction.</p>\n<p>This damage could happen for a wide and ever expanding set of reasons. \u00a0But two things are clear. \u00a0One, flooding the body with oxygen does not cure cancer. \u00a0Two, the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide does not cure cancer, AIDS, or any other disease. \u00a0In fact, the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide will very likely kill you. \u00a0Let me explain how.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer. \u00a0What this means is that it is an unstable chemical at the molecular level. \u00a0See atoms/molecules\u00a0have a little quirk about the number of electrons they have in the outer electron layer. \u00a0If an atom/molecule doesn&#8217;t have the correct number of electrons in the outer most layer, it will do one of three things to correct this problem. \u00a0One, it will give an extra electron to another atom/molecule. \u00a0Two, it will take an electron from another atom/molecule. \u00a0Three, it will bond with another atom/molecule.</p>\n<p>Now hydrogen peroxide, being an oxidizer, takes electrons from the atoms and molecules around it in order to\u00a0stabilize\u00a0itself. \u00a0This\u00a0destabilizes\u00a0the tissues that hydrogen peroxide comes in contact with; creating high concentrations of free radicals which continue to destroy tissues in the body. \u00a0This is also why chlorine gas is so deadly.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_182\" style=\"width: 285px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://greatapethoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hazardous-material-industrial-signs-rtk14bbvply2wy-ba.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-182\" title=\"Hazardous-Material-Industrial-Signs-RTK14BBVPLY2WY-ba\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://greatapethoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hazardous-material-industrial-signs-rtk14bbvply2wy-ba.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://greatapethoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hazardous-material-industrial-signs-rtk14bbvply2wy-ba.jpg 275w, https://greatapethoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hazardous-material-industrial-signs-rtk14bbvply2wy-ba.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is a warning label of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.

Also not the &#8220;DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY,&#8221; warning found at the top of the label.</p></div>\n<p>So what happens to people who take these &#8220;treatments?&#8221; \u00a0Typically, people who ingest solutions of hydrogen peroxide will experience erosion of the stomach lining,\u00a0esophagus, and damage to the various tissues of the mouth. \u00a0People who take these solutions through an IV will see\u00a0deterioration\u00a0of the veins, damage to the blood cells, and erosion of tissues near the injection site. \u00a0If a person is lucky enough to survive when starting these &#8220;treatments,&#8221; they will die as a result of prolonged exposure to hydrogen peroxide.</p>\n<p>This is a dangerous pseudo science that takes advantage of people in duress due to\u00a0chronic\u00a0illness. \u00a0If you know anyone who is\u00a0considering\u00a0hydrogen peroxide &#8220;therapy,&#8221; tell them about the dangers and encourage them to seek\u00a0professional\u00a0treatment for their illness.</p>\n<p>[Edit] Many people have asked me to provide studies for this article. \u00a0Well here they are.</p>\n<p><a

Or, what if it was actually a combination of the other treatments that didn&#8217;t manifest until he began the hydrogen peroxide therapy?</p>\n<p>The best way I can explain my point with this is by quoting youtube scientist C0nc0rdance, &#8220;the plural of anecdote is not data.&#8221;  Science has found many cases where the direct cause of damage to the body came from direct exposure to hydrogen peroxide in concentrated amounts, it&#8217;s been studied to death.  On the other side, the only evidence of the substance curing disease through ingestion comes from the stories that people tell.  The problem with this is that the scientific community has no way of measuring these results.  Was it really the hydrogen peroxide that fought off influenza?  Or, did those old timers do something else that helped them fight the disease that they didn&#8217;t know about or realize, instead attributing their survival to the &#8220;miracle cure&#8221; that they were told helped them?</p>\n<p>On a positive note however, I&#8217;m glad that your friend did manage to fight off the shingles.  I&#8217;ve seen that disease in action and I can&#8217;t imagine what he had to go through.

Many things that are healthy for you will turn harmful if taken in excess. Just how often are there serious problems or fatalities with h202 taken properly? Seems like the only stories of bad medicine come from the long line of continuous recalls by big pharma. And there are countless of these &#8220;interesting antidotes&#8221;, including my own, which I trust more than Merck and phizer. Why is it always a delayed reaction to some drug rather than healing from something that is not a drug. Medical science has proven to make and even hide their mistakes regularly so who are you or some or many so called scientists who are paid by a company in the pharmaceutical business to say that h202 doesn&#8217;t work when so many people have experienced positive results&#8211;often after exhausting medical science.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=602#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-602\", \"602\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to marc mulcahy'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-666\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3fba95e9f69e155f8b43b654fe073801?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='http://N/A' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Marc</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Oct 08, 2013</strong> @ 05:21:42\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-666\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>HERE, HERE!

When it comes to cancer, H2O2 can damage cancer cells, but it&#8217;s like saying that arsenic can cure disease; yes it does kill the harmful bodies, but only because it kills all cells in the body.</p>\n<p>Now when it comes to medical science not finding cures for chronic illnesses such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS, there is always a chance that something was missed.  However, scientists that dedicate their lives to curing these diseases are some of the most hard working and passionate people you could ever meet.

Even then, hydrogen peroxide would destabilize the surrounding tissues which would make them more susceptible to becoming cancerous.<br />\nIn addition, if hydrogen peroxide is injected, the oxidation could easily cause internal bleeding, air bubbles in the veins, and necrosis of the flesh around the injection site.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=487#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-487\", \"487\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Great Ape Thoughts'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-574\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e98aaf71297f75979731e86c98640741?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Bruno</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jul 26, 2013</strong> @ 23:23:00\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-574\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>They&#8217;re very diluted doses of H2O2.

The grades are as follows:</p>\n<p>A) 3.5% Pharmaceutical Grade: This is the grade sold at your local drugstore or supermarket. This product is not recommended for internal use. It contains an assortment of stabilizers which shouldn&#8217;t be ingested. Various stabilizers include: acetanilide, phenol, sodium stanate and tertrasodium phosphate.</p>\n<p>B) 6% Beautician Grade: This is used in beauty shops to color hair and is not recommended for internal use.</p>\n<p>C) 30% Reagent Grade: This is used for various scientific experimentation and also contains stabilizers. It is also not for internal use.</p>\n<p>D) 30% to 32% Electronic Grade: This is used to clean electronic parts and not for internal use.</p>\n<p>E) 35% Technical Grade: This is a more concentrated product than the Reagent Grade and differs slightly in that phosphorus is added to help neutralize any chlorine from the water used to dilute it.</p>\n<p>F) 35% Food Grade: This is used in the production of foods like cheese, eggs, and whey-containing products. It is also sprayed on the foil lining of aseptic packages containing fruit juices and milk products. THIS IS THE ONLY GRADE RECOMMENDED FOR INTERNAL USE. It is available in pints, quarts, gallons or even drums. Various suppliers are mentioned later in this article.</p>\n<p>G) 90%: This is used as an oxygen source for rocket fuel.</p>\n<p>This information can be easily found here: <a href=\"http://educate-yourself.org/cancer/benefitsofhydrogenperozide17jul03.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://educate-yourself.org/cancer/benefitsofhydrogenperozide17jul03.shtml</a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=215#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-215\", \"215\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Rachel'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-greatapethoughts bypostauthor odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-218\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2dcfd4a0518dfb917301a341969c0818?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Great Ape Thoughts</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Feb 08, 2013</strong> @ 21:09:02\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-218\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Like I said, educate-yourself.org is not a credible source for information.

If I had the money to afford subscriptions to peer-review literature I could have easily given you better data.  However, the studies that I could access all show that H2O2 is a powerful oxidizer.  It strips the electrons from living tissue, ALL living tissue; not just pathogens or cancer cells.  If you consume large amounts of it, it can kill you.  If you inject it into your vascular system, you get air bubbles in your blood and suffer from internal bleeding.  And if you dilute it as much as you say you should, it would only react with the cells in your mouth and throat before degrading; meaning it would never even get to the pathogens in your blood or internal organs.</p>\n<p>I have yet to find a peer-reviewed, professionally published study that proves the effectiveness of this &#8220;therapy&#8221; by the modern scientific model.  So far, I have only seen anecdotal stories from people or claims that it works because the &#8220;government/big pharma/ivory tower scientists&#8221; are suppressing it for some gain.  And to quote a great scientist, &#8220;the plural of anecdote is not data.&#8221;   </p>\n<p>I can tell that I&#8217;m not going to convince you that hydrogen peroxide therapy is not valid, and is in fact dangerous.  So this is me respectfully exiting the debate.  You have a few studies that you can go over, and you&#8217;re free to do your own research.  But I have other things I want to talk about on this blog.  Thank you for debating me, and for giving me my next topic in a round-about way.  Best of luck.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-308\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 19, 2013</strong> @ 16:07:50\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-308\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Probably the same dangers as to taking any other medication if you ingest to much&#8230; Really..</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=308#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-308\", \"308\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to '>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-311\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a9708cf863d57c195f6d9b96b6a298d1?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Mike</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 24, 2013</strong> @ 02:11:31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-311\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>You might want to do some more reading.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=311#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-311\", \"311\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mike'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-greatapethoughts bypostauthor even depth-5 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-312\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2dcfd4a0518dfb917301a341969c0818?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Great Ape Thoughts</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 24, 2013</strong> @ 05:56:01\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-312\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>care to give me some sources?

Pharmaceutic companies are subject to the human flaws of their CEO&#8217;s and trusties.  They also have an obligation to turn a profit to their share holders.  However, people who enter the pharmacy profession tend to want the best for people.  I personally know a young woman who entered the profession because her mother nearly died due to a doctor&#8217;s misdiagnosis.  She is one of the most caring and compassionate people I have ever meet.  Yes there are flaws and greed in the system, but I do not believe that these companies are inherently evil, or up to no good.</p>\n<p>Now when it comes to the idea that there is no money in a cure or they are trying to suppress a cure, I would like to propose a hypothetical situation.  Let&#8217;s say that hydrogen peroxide therapy did cure the diseases that it supposedly cures. Companies would make millions off of this cure by making hydrogen peroxide a controlled substance.  Since it is dangerous to consume in un-regulated doses, the pharmaceutic companies would simply pay off politicians to make it illegal to purchase H2O2 without a prescription.  This would then drive up the price and put money in the pockets of the industry.  </p>\n<p>While it would be nice if the health care industry was more honest and helpful to the public, the idea that they are collectively hurting the public to turn a product is an over-extradition.  It is also not valid evidence to say that the suppression of a product/service is proof of it&#8217;s validity.  This falls under the concept of &#8220;conformation bias.&#8221;  To truly keep an open mind, the validity of any claim needs to be examined on it&#8217;s own merits, not the claims of other people.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=265#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-265\", \"265\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Great Ape Thoughts'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-575\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e98aaf71297f75979731e86c98640741?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Bruno</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jul 26, 2013</strong> @ 23:34:33\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-575\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The people who work in the pharmacies believe the same things that you do, because the FDA is GOD.

As I read your posts &#8220;Great Ape&#8221; I am amazed at your lack of research, &#8220;Ape&#8221;, the first thing you need to understand is, contrary to your belief the medical field is in babyland, and don&#8217;t have cures for many things out there.  This is why people take matters into their own hands (Note to medical professionals, stop worrying about money and start saving people).  Remember the word  oxidizing agent simply means one element can break down another via a chemical reaction as you described above. (Its not a scary term by any means)</p>\n<p>Pure hydrogen peroxide has a pH of 6.2; thus it is considered to be a weak acid. The pH can be as low as 4.5 when diluted at approximately 60%. Lower at 50% and so on.  Ph of soda (Coke is 2.5 rounded).  You want to dilute to that consistency if used so you dont burn a hole through your stomach.</p>\n<p>As I was reading through WikipediA, I found an excerpt as follows:</p>\n<p> &#8220;The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of hydrogen peroxide in their lungs than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in their lungs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This suggests that we produce it naturally.  As I did more research, I found that aging or dying  cells produce H2O2 (At low levels).  This would lead me to believe that we may be trying to invoke a healing process.  More research will be conducted to prove this out. </p>\n<p>Ah, you will all be interested in the following:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080102134129.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080102134129.htm</a></p>\n<p>Introduction:</p>\n<p> Todd Lowther, Ph.D., developed a three-dimensional snapshot of how two proteins produced by cells interact to regulate the levels of hydrogen peroxide &#8220;in the body&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It basically states that our body has a built in mechanism to disburse H2O2 via peroxiredoxin (prx) &#8220;that our own cells produce&#8221;, however H2O2 at high levels, this protein will shut down and stop the reduction of H2O2 because it gets damaged in the process, which is my mind where ingestion can become dangerous.  Like the body, if you where going to use it as a therapy, It should be done in short intervals.  H2O2, is a toxin to our body, however serves a purpose in healing.  One of the issues I see is, if you already have a high production of this element H2O2, and you add more, you could be causing yourself a lot of damage, However, it deserves my interest from what I have read so far.</p>\n<p>H2O2 is used naturally by the body to fight bacteria, however should be used in low levels, I would dilute it more than 30% so the body can remove it.  I still don&#8217;t know its affects on fungus as of yet, but I will conduct my own experiments to conclude.</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>I believe this could be used, provably for bacteria issues, i.e. infections.  I seen no supporting evidence that this treatment will cure anything else.  As humans we have a lot of bacteria in our bodies, so I imagine that the immune response you get from ingestion is positive in the short run, and thus can be used in the short term.  Long term, I imagine that you will kill off your ability to remove H2O2 from you system and end up with a toxic overload in your system.  This means, if you use it, use it one week on, one week off, even at small doses to give your body time to repair the Prx protein via sulfiredoxin (Srx).</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind, I am not a doctor, and neither is &#8220;Ape&#8221; we are just smart people doing research of other smart people, my advice, dont read the hype adds of people trying to sell a product, do your own research to come to a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Doctors still use this treatment, and make no mistake, in high amounts this element can kill you (Like any drug can).  If your going to do anything like this, you should be monitored by a doctor to test H2O2 levels (if such a test exists), if your a doctor, chime in.</p>\n<p>In short &#8220;Ape&#8221;, stop believing the hype before you read (Bad Hype, Good Hype).  I makes you appear less intelligent than you are (You seem like you have a good head on your shoulders, you just need to be an intuitive thinker). try to develop some of your own theory&#8217;s via research instead of simply reading the chemical grade H2O2 excerpts at concentrations of 90% undiluted and regurgitating that data.  Your better than that.  Come back at this post with some real data, people want to know the answer because people are sick, and doctors dont have the answer, doctors, chime in any time. </p>\n<p>(Doctors, The only profession where you don&#8217;t have to do your job to get paid.  Its easier for you to call the patient crazy, than it is for you to do research to find out what may be the cause of the issue. (TO MUCH WORK I GUESS))</p>\n<p>Oh, doctors, if the above research is wrong, its doctor publications I use, maybe you should agree on facts instead of theory&#8217;s, theory&#8217;s help nobody.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=268#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-268\", \"268\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Robert'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-greatapethoughts bypostauthor even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-281\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2dcfd4a0518dfb917301a341969c0818?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Great Ape Thoughts</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Apr 21, 2013</strong> @ 06:47:05\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-281\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>First of all, thank you for not flat out attacking me in your comment.  It was very appreciated.  Now on to your points.</p>\n<p>I have talked to two pharmacists and a pediatric trauma surgeon about the production of hydrogen peroxide in the body.  And they all told me that the body produces H2O2 as a result of damage to the cells.  While this process can kill off pathogens in the body, it is not an intentional process.  When you cite the fact that asthma suffers have higher levels of H2O2 in their systems, this is because of an improper absorption of oxygen.  I would also like to point out that I have asthma so I have learned a lot about the condition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to point out the logical falicies in your argument, not to attack or belittle you, but to make a point about research.  First of all, the fact that H2O2 is found in the human body does not automatically mean that it&#8217;s okay to introduce it into the body.  If I were to use Hurley&#8217;s Logic to construct a similar argument, I could say that there are cities that are colder than Siberia, therefor, global warming does not exist.  You have to take into account the idea that cause and effect works both ways.  It could be that the world is getting colder, but it could also mean that Siberia is getting warmer.  Until proper experimentation is conducted, cause and effect cannot be assumed in any direction.</p>\n<p>It also doesn&#8217;t help your argument when you say that all doctors are in their profession for the money.  I don&#8217;t doubt that there are doctors who care more about their paycheck than their patients.  But you can&#8217;t paint all doctors with the same brush.  Plus, if someone only cared about money, there are many ways to make money that are a hell of a lot easier than the years of intense training it takes to become a doctor.  Try to stay away from statements that hyperbolic.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=281#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-281\", \"281\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Great Ape Thoughts'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-318\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bd48a09d8b60a4e5ad035385524ac72e?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Sean</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 25, 2013</strong> @ 17:11:16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-318\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Thank you for that last comment about doctors always being in it for the money.

Your arguments fall on deaf ears, not because of poor education but from ENHANCED education &#8211; born from a willingness to seek answers from sources other than those that have been bought and paid for by big pharma.

They might need insight from you, and being anonymous makes your credibility void.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=282#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-282\", \"282\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mark Ross'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-273\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e786bfa9a10f7409b000f0f37d61d248?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Jan Smith</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Apr 05, 2013</strong> @ 08:23:40\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-273\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>HAS to be food grade and HAS to be diluted to SAFE concentrations.

NO proponent of H202 is recommending you use the regular store brand.  That stuff has all kinds of toxic chemicals in it that stabilize the h202, where as FOOD GRADE H2O2 is PURE.  AND, you gave the dog waaaay too much at a high concentrated level, even if it was food grade.  SO, this is a terrible and irresponsible example.  Think about it.  Vitamin C is great for you, but if you take too much, it gives you diarreah.  Same with Magnesium.  In fact, if you take too much potassium, it will kill you!  BUT, potassium is a necessary nutrient.  Again, I don&#8217;t confirm or deny the use of food grade h202, but all these examples that are negative, have NOTHING to do with whether H202, if used properly, is good or bad.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=285#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-285\", \"285\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Mark Ross'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-293\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a4b4b30d33a92453a3410053e57c3299?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Brenda</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>May 18, 2013</strong> @ 03:02:34\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-293\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>While I have no first hand experience with hydrogen peroxide curing disease, I have found it to be a wonderful replacement for chemicals in my home.  The issue I have with nay-sayers, though, is that many would be quick to advocate a &#8220;treatment&#8221; for cancer such as toxic chemotherapy, but will down a more natural approach such as peroxide?  If faced with cancer, you can bet I would go with peroxide before I would go with chemo.  I know plenty of people who have gone through painful chemo, only to die shortly after, after living a miserable existence during the treatment.

I had been exposed to the Herpes virus and had some very unpleasant sores in a very sensitive area if you know what I mean. I read about the H2O2 therapy and began drinking it, and ramping up to the dosage of 25 drops 3 X daily.  Sores went away..  After maintaining maximum dosage for a short time, I reduced the amount to the maintenance dosage.  After a while I got lazy and tired of the bad taste and stopped..  a couple months later, geuss what returned?  I am now taking it again for the last several months, and no return of the sores.  I feel better when I take it, and I am happy to deal with the bad tast verses the sores..  I have never vomited or had any other negative effects of drinking it, however I am careful to not have anything (food) in my stomach, and I never eat anything for an hour after taking it.  I have no idea if it really is a cure for all the stuff like cancer, etc.. but I can tell you it helps with my condition..

In the US, the medical community has a monopoly on dispensing medical advice.  It is illegal for anyone else to say anything about medical treatments.  If they do, they are subject to litigation and removal of their licenses for their professions.  There may be some folks in big pharma and the FDA that want to suppress info on hydrogen peroxide, and there are certainly many good people in both organizations that would never do such a thing as suppress good info. </p>\n<p> I think the issue is more one of perspective.  The medical community and big pharma have no reason to pay any attention to H2O2 it at all.  They are businesses and must engage in profitable activity.  Their main focus is the treatment of diseases, not on increasing health.  This distinction sounds subtle, but over the last 50 years I think has clearly shown that disease oriented questions as the basis of medical experiments have yet to find cures for any significant chronic illness.  In fact, per capita chronic illnesses have increased exponentially, as have the use of drugs and surgery to combat them.  </p>\n<p>If hydrogen peroxide is not a specific cure for a mechanism that scientists have nailed down to a particular disease, but rather a palliative that increases general body health, and then the body itself has greater resources to combat the disease, medical science would have a really hard time finding it.  Imagine performing an experiment where you try to prove or disprove the causal effect of something that increases general health.  There are quite a few things that get in the way of proving any definitive causal relationships unless you can watch the entire thing go down, in one event, in the microscope.</p>\n<p>But really, there would be no reason to even research it, since there would be no profit in it.  Since hydrogen peroxide is something that nearly any chemical company can profitably make, there would be a huge cost of research in proving causal health effects, with no monopoly on distribution of the substance, so no way to turn a profit.  Thus no reason for big pharma to research.  No chemical company is going to jump into FDA research either.  The idea of trying to make it a controlled substance to make a profit is a poor business plan.<br />\nI don&#8217;t know if H2O2 taken in low concentrations does increase general health, but there&#8217;s no way a peer-reviewed paper will ever have a longitudinal study of it, because there&#8217;s no money in it.  We&#8217;d need some trust fund baby to be interested enough in it to fund the research for general knowledge.  However, there have been several testimonies by folks here that have safely taken it.  Unless they are lying, I&#8217;d say taking it under the watchful care of a doctor you trust should be harmless, scare tactics denying.<br />\nSee the thing is, and anecdote is a data point, just a useless one for determining cause and effect for everybody.  It&#8217;s a good enough one for me to try it though (I mean really, we make decisions based on anecdotes all the time).</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=744#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-744\", \"744\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to royalestel'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-307\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 19, 2013</strong> @ 16:00:39\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-307\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>If you did your research, you are not suppose to but 3% at the drug store.

If they say its bad you know its good!</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=1138#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-1138\", \"1138\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Ivona'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-316\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/259de3e19662dfb5ac23920e362f80a5?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>TheSparko</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 25, 2013</strong> @ 07:16:25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-316\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>okay, I see your cause of concern.<br />\nI also recognize everyone&#8217;s immediate dispute involving the practice of medicine, pharmaceutical companies and the legitimacy of oxygen therapy as a whole.</p>\n<p>After researching, and really just getting a strong insight on the whole phenomena &#8211; I&#8217;ve noticed that your argument for the danger of FOOD grade (35%) on the human body is completely justified. Food grade peroxide is extremely hazardous to the body &#8211; and will cause burns &amp; death if ingested. </p>\n<p>However, now I ask you keep an open mind about this. Firstly, the correct way to actually ingest hydrogen peroxide is to dilute it. there are different measures for how much one should dilute it, but the general idea is to dilute it down so it does not cause any severe problems. Oxygen toxicity and internal burns therefore no longer become an issue &#8211; because the amount you actually take in is very dilute. The idea is to take it over a longer period of time, in small dosages.</p>\n<p>I would also like to address the inherent problems with your &#8216;studies&#8217;. Without meaning to be rude, but those links are not studies at all, they are in fact articles from government-backed websites that only serve to agree with my previous statements. Yes, 35% Food grade HP WILL cause some serious problems if one is misinformed enough to ingest it. Furthermore, none of your articles provide any specific information as to how much Hydrogen peroxide has been taken. I have avoided mentioning the evermore visible systemic problems with the foundations of our modern healthcare structure &#8211; but it is important that I point out that this concern of HP being dangerous is a fallacy in it&#8217;s own right. </p>\n<p>&#8216;Food grade&#8217; HP is being sold illegally due to the idea that normal, brown bottle over the counter HP contain unsavory stabilizers, and other preservatives. This is seeded from a large distrust of the FDA, and pharmaceutical companies alike. The truth is, a 3% bottle is comprised of 97% distilled water, and 3% HP &#8211; nothing else. When in contact with sunlight, the HP will naturally dissolve into into it&#8217;s more fundamental components &#8211; hence why it is kept in a brown bottle. So, the idea of this &#8216;food grade&#8217;, 35% solution is product that solely adheres to the paranoia of the public. The FDA is trying to stop illegal sales of this product because yes, it is dangerous if ingested, but it also fails to recognize that the FDA, combined with other pharma companies are the sole reasons that this product is being shipped illegally in the first place. The only way to solve this is to take some advice, and just stick to ordinary brown bottle stuff.    After checking the back of the label on my own brand of HP &#8211; I&#8217;ve discovered that it contains Phenacetin and phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is contained within coca cola, and phenacetin, which is contained in vicks cold tablets and is a non-opiod pain reliever. These are both completely harmless when taken in such small amounts.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of HPs effectiveness at fighting disease &#8211; this is probable something that most of us here have actually overlooked. You seem to use the word &#8216;pseudoscience&#8217; to describe it. But is there the slightest possibility that you have perhaps misjudged this entirely and jumped to conclusions too quickly? I mean, yes &#8211; you do have a legitimate concern for high concentration HP being sold uninformed buyers &#8211; which would result in dangerous outcomes. But now that we have established that no longer becomes an issue if a sensible dosage is taken &#8211; could there be room for now a legitimate, working theory as to how HP does actually help the body?</p>\n<p>If part of you is thinking yes, then I shall try and explain as briefly as possible. Let&#8217;s go back to the start &#8211; you ingest HP in a sensible, non harmful dosage. You get a massive boost in oxygen going throughout your whole system &#8211; this will seem pleasant too, as it will give you more energy. and sure, it will kill off bacteria as it doesn&#8217;t live in the presence of oxygen. But this won&#8217;t cure cancer or do anything spectacular at all. The real &#8216;miracle&#8217; is in what it does to your body&#8217;s pH. It turns it into an alkaline state. Now, what&#8217;s the significance of this you may ask? well this study: <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/az/sthurston/Killing_Cancer_Cells_with_High_pH_Therapy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.angelfire.com/az/sthurston/Killing_Cancer_Cells_with_High_pH_Therapy.html</a> &lt;&#8211; shows that high ph therapy actually kills cancer cells. Of course, this study is actually exclusive from HP all together , as they treated the patients with Cesium, and not HP.</p>\n<p>I understand that this may not be conclusive evidence to a skeptic, but I hope not to convince you with a mini essay I wrote at 8 in the morning, but only to expose you to the possibility that there is something far more significant that we, and the modern world of medicine have overlooked. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXWXhp6aFuw\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXWXhp6aFuw</a> Here is a video of a doctor who is well established with this new area of medicine &#8211; he will confirm the mechanics of how HP actually works, and also give insight into a case of pH/oxygen therapy. My main critical point is that oxygen therapy basically works under the principles of pH therapy (increasing pH). And thus, oxygen therapy is only  a redundant term.  </p>\n<p>That&#039;s it (:, forgive me for any poor grammar, as i wrote this at 7 in the morning, so it&#039;s a little raw! I would also like to apologize for the length of this post and would like to thank you for your patience in reading it.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=316#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-316\", \"316\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to TheSparko'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-greatapethoughts bypostauthor even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-320\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2dcfd4a0518dfb917301a341969c0818?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Great Ape Thoughts</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jun 26, 2013</strong> @ 01:01:16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-320\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Well thank you for writing a well thought out response.  It is true that there are many factors that go into the cure for cancer, and the ph of the environment is one of them.  The problem with using hp therapy is that when hp is diluted as much as it is, it oxidizes with the tissues in the mouth and throat.  This means that the substance would never make it to any cancer cells.  The other risk from the use of hp in the body comes from oxidation stress.  This happens when cells are exposed to oxidizers, which damage the dna and can lead to cancer development.  It&#8217;s something that does need to be looked into, but until we know more about these issues, the public should avoid treatments that are currently known to do more harm than good.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=320#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-320\", \"320\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Great Ape Thoughts'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-mickscadding odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-687\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3eeaeb041ec98433c7797ebc5091eedb?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='http://gravatar.com/mickscadding' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Skitz</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Oct 19, 2013</strong> @ 09:41:26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-687\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>From what I understand, H2O2 diluted in the body does not oxidise normal healthy human cells as they are protected by enzymes, whereas unhealthy cells and organisms are not.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=687#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-687\", \"687\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Skitz'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-333\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jul 07, 2013</strong> @ 07:14:40\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-333\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>You clearly have never studied any biology.

Tap or mineral water contains dissolved minerals that will react with the extra oxygen, wasting it.</p>\n<p>Never take hydrogen peroxide with food in your stomach. For most people this means an hour and a half either side of food. However if you feel a little nauseous after taking the H2O2 it could be because you haven&#8217;t left it long enough. Vitamin C, iron and fats in the stomach change hydrogen peroxide into super-oxide free radicals . This can severely damage the lining of your stomach . The same is true of iron, copper, silver or manganese so if you are supplementing these minerals DO NOT TAKE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE INTERNALLY.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=325#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-325\", \"325\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Pete'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-326\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bb6060ead0d3d19e4339607aa7c7a342?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Elizabeth</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jul 03, 2013</strong> @ 20:17:29\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-326\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Dear Ape, I think you did not proof your point at all.

Ape must work for Big Pharma. We&#8217;ve taken small amounts of hydrogen peroxide over the last 3 years (i.e. &#8211; occasionally adding 3 to 4 drops in a glass of water.) We have never felt better, breathed better, or had so much energy. We feel entirely rejuvenated w/this simple protocol. History lesson: Food grade H.P. occurred naturally in rain water until the air became overly saturated with various pollutants, thereby wiping out H.P.&#8217;s beneficial effects prior to it being able to fall in either our soil or water. That is why we are deficient in this all important element. Big Pharma can&#8217;t make money from it &#8211; so are in the business of fear-mongering &#8211; much like the Cancer Industry does, since keeping people sick with cancer is a massive money maker. There will never be a proclaimed cure for cancer by either Big Pharma or the Medical Association for that very lucrative reason. The entire industry is a sham, and controlled by corporations.

Thus putting people like me in positions of having to try something different! To my betterment or to my detriment! So far in my research I have come across way more stories that ingesting H202 has greater benefits that not! Now I could be wrong and only time will tell. Will you believe me if I come back and share with you of the positive results?! Or will I be just another kook?

Both sides of this argument have everyone&#8217;s best interest at heart.  Yes, there are probably large scale conspiracies with drug companies protecting their interests, but the answer isn&#8217;t dividing ourselves.  Our answer is objective debate and unbiased studies using the modern scientific method; where we look at both sides equally and understand that as humans we are prone to cognitive dissonance and conformation bias.  I would love to see some REAL studies on the effects of food grade hydrogen peroxide taken internally with the recommended dose.

My experience has proven first hand, that most doctors are not interested in uncovering the source of one\u2019s ailment, but rather very motivated to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs designed only to suppress symptoms, not cure the underlying issue, which let&#8217;s face it, is the MAIN reason why the body creates &#8220;symptoms&#8221; in the first place! \u2026To alert you to an underlying problem that needs to be realized and resolved, NOT masked.</p>\n<p>I was recently reminded of my ex-neighbor, Art, who looked like he was in his 60&#8217;s was in fact in his 90&#8217;s. He explained to me one day that he been ingesting 35% Food Grade HP for most of his life and was very much alive and well at 92 years of age; full of life, in incredible physical shape, mentally clear, with ample energy and infectious enthusiasm. </p>\n<p>I can tell you from personal experience that in the 6+ years I knew him, he had not been sick a single day. He built homes for people in Big Bear with his bare hands and collected natural accent materials (rock and stones) from the land, each night after he stopped working on his home projects every day.<br />\nArt was amazing in every sense of the word&#8230; he scaled fences like a teenager!  </p>\n<p>Our cat had been stuck in a tree for 2 days, when we saw Art, he asked what was going on, then without any hesitation, climbed onto our roof, and proceeded to create a make shift pulley with a bucket and some rope, he rescued our cat, gave me a hug and then headed off to continue his original task.</p>\n<p>Desperate to find relief, I continued my search and have finally located a doctor who practices alternative medicine. I am pleased to report that in just 6-weeks, he has done what all the others have failed to do, which is have me tested to uncover the root cause of my illness and provide a solution that is based on HEALING the body, not merely treating the symptoms of discomfort.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m confident all the &#8220;nay-sayers&#8221; of HP therapy would agree, in the 4 years of general medical &#8220;attention&#8221; I received, I demonstrated sufficient patience to have allowed any potential benefit from said treatments to have improved my health crisis, which they did not. And that after discontinuing said treatments for six months, before I located a doctor who practiced alternative medicines, that adequate time lapsed, where one could not mistake the recent improvement in my health to have been a &#8220;delayed reaction&#8221; from previous medical treatments.</p>\n<p>We moved back to the city, a few years ago, so I lost contact with Art, or I might have been more mindful of this HP therapy and perhaps I would have corrected or even prevented my health issues&#8230;  All I know is I am grateful to have discovered it!</p>\n<p>Obviously, anyone considering this therapy, should be sure to research the company supplying the 35% Food Grade HP to ensure efficacy, as well as being extremely cautious to clearly mark any container with the HP content, so as to prevent the risk of accidental over-dose.</p>\n<p>I am also a believer that the AMA, Big Pharma and the FDA are all working together to ensure they do not lose their hearty trillion dollar profits to anyone providing permanent cures to any disease.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=648#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-648\", \"648\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Love The Life You Live'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-700\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3fba95e9f69e155f8b43b654fe073801?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='http://N/A' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Marc</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Nov 02, 2013</strong> @ 14:51:25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-700\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>I am a 53 year old truck driver who also have been degenerating and getting worst as the years go by. To the point where I have found myself to weigh 300 Lbs with swollen legs and poor circulation to the point of not being able to walk up a half a flight of stairs without having to gasp for air. My feet felt like they were on fire and numb most of the time. The Doctor placed me on diuretics of witch I was on for over three months to help remove some of the fluid that had built up in my legs to no avail. I also have been diagnosed with arthritis in my mid upper back that caused me allot of discomfort and nagging pain that went through my entire body that I found myself having to take up to two Alieve and 2 to 3 Tramasets and a half hour long hot shower on my knees  just to function in the morning. This constant pain in my back and legs  is what helped cause my being over weight as exercise was not something that I wanted to do! I also had stomach issues that left me feeling like someone punched me in the abdomen all the time when ever I exerted myself  witch  also caused my shortness of breath witch in turn didn&#8217;t help me with my wanting to exercise which also lead to my lack of exercise and my being over weight. In short, all of these issues played a significant roll in two marriage brake ups and to the eventual loss of my long term job. Now I have spent over two decades with these issues for which I have sought medical help, and all to no avail! I have gone for M.R.I. &#8216;s C.T. scans, bone scans, ultra sound, countless blood tests just to name a few, and all for not! So as the old saying go&#8217;s. Desperate people do desperate things! One day a friend who has been using H202 for years told me about this controversial use of H202 by ingesting it and of all the claims that followed it. So having tried everything else I began researching and reading personal testimonies and their claims to healing then decided try it. On the first week I started finding myself having more energy. On the second week I found that I not only had more energy, I also found that my back leg pain was not as prominent. So I thought I would stop taking my Alieve and trameset to see if the pain would increase, and to my surprise it did not. So I completely stopped taking it ,only to report that I am now going on my third week of H202 therapy without pain killers for my arthritis! Also due to fear of what being on diuretics for my fluid retention would have if I mixed it with the H202 I stopped taking this as well but this time I stopped before I began taking H202 only to report that the swelling in my legs has significantly gone down and the burning sensation in my feet has greatly diminished and the cramps and pain that I had in my legs is all but gone! Also I have found that my stomach issues seem to have gone away to the point that I was also able to walk up two flights of stairs without having to stop to catch my breath half way up and at the top. ! I have also found that my apatite has greatly diminished #1 due to the fact that one must not eat 2 to 3 hours before and after the ingestion of H202 but also it seems that I find my self not as hungry. To which I am reporting that my size 46 jeans aren&#8217;t as tight tight on me! So. In conclusion, I am now starting on my third week of H202 feeling quite optimistic and encouraged that there is hope after all! Yesterday I went out tricker treating with my two young boys and I found my self walking around five or six blocks or so without having to stop due to pain and shortness of breath! So for you skeptics out there, till you&#8217;ve walked a mile in someones desperate shoes, don&#8217;t knock it! Now this having been said I don&#8217;t know what side effects that I may encounter in the future due to ingesting H202. But for now, I am reporting that My life has taken a significant change for the better and I am going to continue on my 30 day regiment of H202!  I will report again after I have concluded. Sincerely: A believer in H202</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=700#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-700\", \"700\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Marc'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-nuffzed odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-652\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0233d7119f8ae1fe46c2fb6d4db35e9e?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='http://nuffzed.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>nuffzed</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Sep 23, 2013</strong> @ 04:58:13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-652\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>@greatapethoughts&#8230;Please spend more time reading &#8216;Game of Thrones&#8217; than writing this ego massaging blog.<br />\nYou obviously have an articulate brain so that it must be clear to you that you are NOT winning this argument.<br />\nPlease don&#8217;t let yourself be put into the same bracket as Snopes and Quackwatch.<br />\nPeople are waking up to the Allopathic domination of our health and are tired of it.<br />\nFor goodness sake, use your valuable time in researching something useful&#8230;</p>\n<p>NB: 35% Food Grade H2o2 diluted 1 part 35% to 11 parts distilled water is a wonderful gargle and mouth-wash which destroys all the bacteria that produces bad breath.

I have come along this Ape page&#8230;. I am also  proud of these ppl here, who I do not know, writing seriously to a person that  disgraces  the True Great Apes! &#8230;.Proof? I have poof as of last night with my 18 yrold cat who had a boody diarear stool for months, the sonogram  read tumors in lower abdominal area and liver. My vet at the ny humane society said, this is very bad, humanely the best to do for her is to &#8221; put her to sleep&#8221;. I am a fighter and so is my cat. I had nothing to lose since she was declining every day with no appetite , no energy, and water of blood coming out of her. I put my 3% of 35% human grade Hydrogen Peroxiod in her water dishes and indoor pet fountains , gave appox. her 2xs a day from an eye dropper a diluted solution I configured keeping in mind she is cat  and dying,  also after 18 yrs, I bought her outside for the first time, in friend&#8217;s backyards to smell the life outdoors.she blossomed into a reborn kitten!!!!!!!<br />\nAs I said last night she is eating healthy cat food herself , previously I had to force feed her baby food.<br />\nThe BIG proof is she went to the litter box, spritely and pooped a turd that was solid and NO Blood!!!!!!!&#8230;.She is still coming along. But she was on her death bed with what was more likely to be cancerous tumors! At 18 yrs. old, to do an exploritory operation would have killed her.<br />\nI am truly in shock that my cat has come back from the almost dead.<br />\nI was thinking another ultra sound now would be proof!<br />\nI can not offord spending another $400. For this. I &#8216;m in New York city.<br />\nAnd  struggle since my back problems&#8230;. Another story unrelated.<br />\nI just googled cures with HPT. And came across this post.<br />\nSorry for peaking harshly in the beginning, but my feelings are that if you yourself have no proof yourself , do not condemn what can be !<br />\nAnd my cat is living a better life since HPT given she has come back from her death bed and now is progressing,. And lifestyle change was getting her outside, this too made her a reborn again kitty.<br />\nThanks for this oppornuty to give voice to what is not talked about in main stream media!</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=654#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-654\", \"654\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Linda'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-660\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ecf63dc168c03fd2c7205c5dc2ab81?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>David Donaldson</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Oct 04, 2013</strong> @ 04:05:16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-660\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>You are so right.

I have read the entire thing and have learned a lot.  So I would like to thank you for that.  </p>\n<p>However, I would like to ask you think about your borrowed quote &#8220;the plural of anecdote is not data&#8221;.  While this appears to be valid on the surface, I started thinking about it further.  There is another quote that comes to mind, &#8220;where there is smoke there is fire.&#8221;   When you have this many people that have had positive results with their own experiences, you have to consider the possibility that they are onto something.  </p>\n<p>And here is another thought along those lines.  Let&#8217;s assume that we put together a &#8220;study&#8221; or a scientific research experiment with 1000 people who use diluted food grade HP at the recommended levels for oral ingestion for a month.  And let&#8217;s assume that 5 groups of 200 each all have different ailments that we are studying.  In our study, how would we log the results?   Would we not interview them and get their story?  Would we not ask them about their eating habits and how HP ingestion made them feel?  And wouldn&#8217;t we log those results that would become data points?  Of course we would. </p>\n<p>My point is that, while this forum is not a formal study, that informal anecdotes can be points of data that should at least be considered to motivate one in performing a formal study.  The anecdotes from that study most assuredly would be considered data.  </p>\n<p>I believe that your willingness to consider the possibility that you may have initially been wrong in your stance would go a long way in providing balance in your discussion.  I am still undecided in this debate and would love to see a more comprehensive study done.  I am still searching for the answer and have not closed my mind to either side yet.  </p>\n<p>However, as it stands, many many people have given us examples from their own experience that are the highest form of proof for them.  No, it is not formal science, but it is worthy or our consideration, because to borrow another great quote, &#8220;the proof is in the pudding&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>Chris</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=681#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-681\", \"681\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Chris Harper'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-greatapethoughts bypostauthor odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-695\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2dcfd4a0518dfb917301a341969c0818?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Great Ape Thoughts</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Oct 29, 2013</strong> @ 02:01:59\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-695\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Thank you for reading, and sorry I haven&#8217;t been on in a while.  I have a lot on my plate right now with work and family issues.  </p>\n<p>Now when it comes to the study you are proposing, It would be interesting to do since there is enough information to make a basic observation, which is the first part of the scientific process.  We are observing that there are a number of individuals who are reporting benefits from this therapy.  The next thing we would have to do is form a hypothesis that we could test.  It seems like a good one for our population here is that Hydrogen Peroxide therapy can work as a powerful anti-viral in the right dose; I say this because there are a number of comments that are reporting having viral infections cured.  We would then take a large population of people who are suffering from a viral infection and get as much data about them as we can.  This data would include other medications being taken, diet, age, sex, smoking and drinking habits, stuff like that so the experimenters can account for any other causes of data change. It would not be a good idea to take groups of people with many different ailments since it would overwhelm the study and ruin the results. We would also need to have a placebo and/or control group.  This is done to test if the treatment is actually helping people, or if they are becoming biased and miss-reporting symptoms that they think are not there anymore.  If the results are greater than the control/placebo group, then it is very likely that the data is accurate and not the result of any biases on the part of the testers or subjects.</p>\n<p>To log the data, there would be many factors.  One of them would be patient testimony, but others would be blood tests, MRI&#8217;s, culture swabs of infected areas, and many other tests.  This is again to guarantee that the study is not thrown off by something like conformation bias.</p>\n<p>In fact, conformation bias is one of the key reasons that anecdotes are not taken as data.  Often times, when people believe in something, they will only pay attention to things that support their belief while ignoring or explaining away the things that contradict it.  It&#8217;s something that nearly everyone does in their lives, myself included.  I&#8217;ll give you a hypothetical.  Let&#8217;s say that a person read somewhere that drinking hose water would prevent headaches.  They start drinking hose water and don&#8217;t have any headaches for a week.  They then believe that the water is working.  The next time that they get a headache, they may write it off as a fluke and forget about having it the next day.  At the end of the month, if you asked them about their headaches, they would say that they didn&#8217;t have any during the month even though they  really did.  This is why the plural of anecdote isn&#8217;t data.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=695#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-695\", \"695\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Great Ape Thoughts'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-701\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Nov 02, 2013</strong> @ 22:24:30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-701\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Great Ape you are a LIAR, and a FOOL..

My interest is in cancer mechanisms and aging. One day my former partner gave me Herpes 2. The disease started with 8 blisters. Nothing for 9  months and following the second OB  the new OBs occurred just twice-trice/ year. In that period I increased my Catalase and SOD levels to reduce oxidation damages at cellular level. This eventually shortened the time between OBs to three weeks. A real hell. 8 blisters every three weeks. I deduced that the virus can exploit catalase and SOD to thrive inside the cells and escape oxidation. Anti-oxidants maintain healthy cells longevity. However, if cells are infected by Herpes 2 they are allegedly virus amplifiers! Reluctantly, I started the standard peroxide oral treatment because there was nothing left to try. After three weeks,  a microscopic OB replaced the usual 8 big blisters. For the first time in three years I had just a small reddish spot with two almost invisible blisters. My simplified conclusion; we have a balance between catalase, SOD and H2O2 levels. Unbalances have different side effects, included aging,  cancer and viral infection.  increasing the concentration of peroxide in the blood stream is certainly effective to reduce the OBs of Herpes. This is my evidence and in couple of months  I will know if peroxide zaps the virus definitely. Concerning the evidence that peroxide will cause me health damage such as DNA damage I cannot know this unless studying in vitro what happens to my DNA at the very low dosage I am taking orally.  However, if someone reads what antivirals and many other drugs do, they will see that there is no safe drug so someone must do their own math. My math is that I stay on peroxide because it almost immediately worked very well with me as no anti-viral drug did.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=692#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-692\", \"692\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Roger'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-693\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53a9863871c0f196ff13f0fbd83431dc?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>edward</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Oct 26, 2013</strong> @ 16:56:58\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-693\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>I really don&#8217;t have a skin in this game as I haven&#8217;t tried this type of therapy because basically I am perfectly healthy but I am curious about the amount of anger directed at APE. His basic argument is to caution people because this type of therapy has not been peer reviewed. The vast majority of the responses seem to be- I don&#8217;t trust the fda or it is a big pharma conspiracy. Some even believe that cancer vaccines are not available because it would eat into profits. These conspiracy theories don&#8217;t hold a whole lot of water in my opinion if you have any knowledge of biotech investing. First, if you believe that big pharma would intentionally not release a vaccine they would have a shareholder revolt. Look at the margins for the HPV vaccines, or Immunocellular&#8217;s vaccine for glioblastoma, or Sangamo with a functional cure for HIV and Huntingtons disease,  etc., These companies are spending billions in phase 1-3 trials to get vaccines/cures because if they don&#8217;t someone else will beat them to the punch. And if you look at the exponential rate at which molecules  are being discovered mainly in silico(reducing traditional research expense) these companies have no choice but to act fast and lock up the patent rights. Another thing that baffles me is that most of you don&#8217;t realize that big pharma works hand in hand with most major universities. So now not only are you claiming big pharma is in on the conspiracy virtually every major university with research facilities is too. Lets not forget that the NIH gets 4.9 billion a year from Congress for cancer research. Do you think that the US government is suppressing cures? Why? Medicare and Medicaid expenses are killing this country. ANY cure or vaccine saves uncle sam a ton of money. </p>\n<p> And lastly, why would any oncologist tell another human being don&#8217;t try hydrogen peroxide therapy(if it is perfectly safe in the right dose). Most doctors I know went into medicine because they want to help people and end suffering. They use the products that have been peer reviewed through FDA testing  because it gives the patient the best chance at survival.  And yes the FDA does have some drugs that have side effects that manifest themselves later on but for the most part the trials are conducted all over the world with large population samples. In my opinion, I would rather trust trials conducted all over the world with thousands of people and a control group then stories about someone&#8217;s uncle jim or their sick cat. Not trying to be insulting, I just cannot fathom that every oncologist is suppressing or not supporting this therapy if there is anything to it. They dedicate their lives to helping people so why would they suddenly be so cruel to deny someone a healthy life for &#8220;pennies a day&#8221;.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=693#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-693\", \"693\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to edward'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-697\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Nov 01, 2013</strong> @ 00:53:23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-697\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Fool</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=697#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-697\", \"697\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to '>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-698\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3eeaeb041ec98433c7797ebc5091eedb?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Skitz</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Nov 01, 2013</strong> @ 08:27:20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-698\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Right on&#8230;.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=698#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-698\", \"698\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Skitz'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-710\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/298371615efb26390cc97cbb3340f169?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Joe Laberge</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Nov 07, 2013</strong> @ 20:27:48\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-710\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Had extreme bowel discomfort for more than 2 years.

And if Great Ape Thoughts means you believe we ascended from monkeys then here in lies the root of the problem..Evolution is just a fairy tale for grown ups.. The truth will set you free, that is the truth not your truth.  Its also quite interesting that the good book (The Bible ) also says that it&#8217;s &#8220;the love of money that is the root of all forms of evil &#8221; Its quite clear that we&#8217;re to love people and use money don&#8217;t ever get this reversed where you love money and use people. This is evil and this is where the paharmaceutical companies go wrong. Interesting the  word behind pharmaceutical is the greek word Pharmacia which means witchcraft and sorcery. I have over the years cured almost everything naturally and not used any form of drug not even a pain killer for 30 years now, and will die before i put their poison into my body..Ive removed skin cancers in under 2 weeks naturally, and have stories that i could go on about for ages. Suffice is to say drugs are about money not health, and the sad part is they all have side effects and prescribed drugs kill more people in the west every year than the Vietnam war did in 10 years.There is a God fortunately and we will all be judged one day, wether you believe it or not wont stop you being accountable to him one day. And where you&#8217;ve put the love of money before the love of people, look out. You have a conscience and thats your spirit letting your know your out of line. Its a pity that ignorance isn&#8217;t painful. And as far as the information not being peer reviewed as posted by others, it has and many,many other natural cures for disease not just therapys. The problem is if the big boys can&#8217;t patent it and make money out of it then  they will discredit it even to the point of lieing and fabricating evidence against it. This is out and out EVIL.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=716#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-716\", \"716\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to peewee'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-718\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://i1.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/100000526954726/picture?q=type%3Dlarge%26_md5%3D45b60567d5048cf0af726f47acfe9bb4&#038;resize=48%2C48' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='https://www.facebook.com/sandy.workman3' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Sandy Workman</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Dec 05, 2013</strong> @ 16:41:20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-718\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>I have to tell everyone who reads this&#8211;I am lung CANCER free&#8211;going on 9yrs now&#8211;with out any pills, or Dr&#8217;s. Plus I haven&#8217;t been sick&#8211;not even the flue, no poison is gonna go in this body. I used chelation to clean my blood. Then I used H2O2 for  fixing it. No, you don&#8217;t drink pure H2O2 of any type. You got to add water to it. !0 drops (35% Food Grade)  to 8 oz of water&#8211;I did it more then 3 times a day&#8211;I did it before bed&#8211;that way it was in my body all night. Then I did it again first thing in the morning. If it up sets your belly&#8211;just drink more water(with out H2O2).  I am a coffee drinker&#8211;so if I wanted another cup&#8211;I had to drink my water first&#8211;wait 15 to 20 mints, then I had my coffee. So I might drink 6 to 10 glasses of H2O2 a day.  I believes it depends on how sick you are, or how fast you want to see results. Everyday I saw results&#8211;I kept notes.  I believe this ad is to scare you from using H2O2. If a pill has a 2-3 page side affect warning&#8211;then don&#8217;t take it==find something else&#8211;I&#8217;m sure ur Dr can give you something safer.  I had circulation  problems&#8211;retaining water , not being able to sweat&#8211;cold 24/7, all year long. I did Chelation, and this fixed my problem. I was able to sweat, lost weight -which was all water. Plus I had so much energy. But the H2O2 did the trick&#8211;I had even more energy, because I had more oxygen in my blood, brain, muscles. I know this is the cure all everyone is looking for&#8211;Just write down everything that is wrong with you&#8211;and for 1 wk&#8211;do the H2O2 and check your list&#8211;if you see an improvement of any kind&#8211;then you know it&#8217;s working. Don&#8217; let anyone run your life&#8211;you just might die.

If more people begin to use h2o2 and benefiting healthwise, then it means less profit for the Pharmaceuticals, since people will be buying less drugs. So disregard APE.

If H2O2 breaks down into by products, one of which is a free radical ,as general chemistry suggests. And free radicals have been  closely linked to aging and cell damage as had been reported for decades.  Then right off the bat, H2o2 seems to be the opposite of the fountain of youth ( and health.)<br />\nBut  Wait there is more\u2026.Some propose that drinking H2O2 boosts one\u2019s energy by supplying extra oxygen (through the gut membrane, no less or directly injected into the blood stream)\u2026but fail to mention that  free oxygen introduces to the blood stream by any other means than by the action of one\u2019s lungs and safely transported throughout the body by hemoglobin can cause damage to platelets, or  air bubbles in the blood that result in blood clots , and death of organs or the whole person if not successfully treated. I remind myself that medical staff go to a lot of trouble to take the air bubble out of the needle before injecting the needle\u2019s contents into my blood. These same questionable health gurus suggest that cancer can be cured by the oxygen supplied by H2O2 but ignore that rapid growth of cancer cells require much more oxygen than normal cells, so supplying abundant oxygen to tumors via injecting or ingesting H2O2 is counter productive even if thrombosis/ blood clots didn\u2019t kill the patient in the first place.</p>\n<p>To add to the list of backward logic,\u2026one is NOT suppose to use the drugstore shelf 3% Hydrogen Peroxide \u201cbecause of impurities\u201d. ( 3% H2O2 is now known to cause scaring and damage healthy cells in  shallow surface wounds). These \u201cgurus\u201d advocate instead  that the average person (who can\u2019t understand the danger of blood clots, free radicals or that cancer cells thrive on oxygen ) should run out and get  35% Food Grade H2O2.  Somehow the average person is to feel safer with a bottle of H2O2 that is 10+xs more scaring and killing to healthy human cells and keep this stuff in their home next to their children and pets.

H2o2  wants more electrons, two very electronegative atoms (the two oxygens) are deparately fighting over the electrons they have between them. This is one way that hydrogen peroxide can oxidize (steel electrons from) other molecules.<br />\n* (H2O2 CANNOT CAUSE FREE RADICALS IN THE BLOODSTREAM, IT PREVENTS OXIDITIVE DAMAGE ,IT CANNOT STEAL ELECTRONS FROM THE HUMAN BODY CELLS BECAUSE OF THE CATALASE ENZYMES THAT  THE HUMAN BODY HAVE IN IT ,THESE ENZYMES ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE BECAUSE IT STOPS THE DECOMPOSITION OF H2O2 RELEASES THE UNSTABLE OXYGEN ATOMS AND BREAKS THEM DOWN INTO WATER (H20) AND PURE OXYGEN (O) (HOWEVER IF YOU INCREASE THE OXYGEN IN YOUR BLOOD TO MUCH THESE ENZYMES CANT SAVE YOU \u201cYOU WILL DIE.\u201d)<br />\n1. ,.You were right about dr. ottos philosophy H2o2 does not cure all types cancer there are so very many different types of cancer that there will never be 1 cure for them all, however it may be possible for an oxygen rich bloodstream to prevent some types<br />\n2 You die from aids not hiv which is an (aid) it weakens your immune system and eventually your body cannot fight off any infecton and the simplest mild common cold can kill you,  (even if someone told you how do you know they are telling the truth,)(but it is a fact that viruses live in the blood and are sensitive to oxygen. Your body produces h2o2 to try to kill the virus , once that doesn\u2019t work the white blood cells attack the virus and lose, There is not enough h2o2 or white bloodcells to win, but if you can somehow increase the oxygen in your blood to its maximum it would be impossible for a blood disease to exist it cant) Warning: if you have a higher than normal amounts of oxygen in your bloodstream and get a skin desease you would have to make the oxygen normal again, you cant take away the oxygen in your body completely which makes it very hard to cure a skin disease.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=735#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-735\", \"735\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to '>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-736\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Dec 22, 2013</strong> @ 10:44:18\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-736\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>H2o2 therapy is completely safe if you know what you are doing. however im shure it has killed a lot of people if they take in too much,<br />\nYou use 3% foodgrade foodgrade hydrogen peroxide not off the shelves , but additive and stabilizer free and you also have to use distilled water.Mix 3 teaspoons into 1 gallon of water at least you can use more water and you have to store it somewhere where there is no light until consumed.<br />\nWhat this would do is increase the oxygen in your blood but not increase it enough to kill you<br />\nWhat more proof can you get than living proof. I have been drinking h2o2 the proper way for 6 years my body is fine stomach lining and throat is fine.I did not have a disease tho so I don\u2019t know if it cures anything I did it to prevent disease therefore I cant tell you if it cures serious blood diseases.I can tell you this tho if you do it exactly how I explained it cannot hurt you what can it hurt it will benefit you.<br />\n (NEVER TRUST ANY ONE SOURCE OR MULTIPLE SOURCES EVEN IF THEY ARE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING, YOU HAVE TO DIG WAY DEEPER THAN THAT, I got my info from many sources confirmed those sources with other sources then confirmed those sources and came to a unquestionable conclusion.

EDUCATE YOURSELFES ON H2O2 BY READING WHAT I AM GOING TO WRITE NOT GOING ON EDUCATEYOURSELF.ORG AND GREAT APE I KNOW YOU PLAN ON WRITING OTHER ARTICLES ABOUT THINGS I READ WHAT YOU WROTE IF YOU ARE NOT 100% RIGHT IT IS BEST TO BE QUIET UNTIL YOU ARE YOU CANT JUST READ MOST OF THINGS AND THINK THEY ARE TRUE. By reading this article I wrote your scientific knowledge of H2o2 will be great in your knowledge great ape and you do have the knowlede to make a difference. I leave no room for what if, and, or but everyones questions will be answere. </p>\n<p>I AM WRITING THIS TO EXPOSE THE WORLD TO THE TRUTH IN A WAY YOU CANNOT DENY AND AN EASIER SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND: THERE ARE A LOT OF RUMORS, SO I AM ELIMINATING ALL OF THEM WITH THIS ARTICLE ON H2O2<br />\n The human body naturally decomposes of low grades of h2o2 hydrogen dioxide, which you know as hydrogen peroxide, when highly deluted and introvaniously taken into the body, there are enzymes in Your body that simply breaks it down to water (h20) and pure oxygen (o) increasing the oxygen in your blood. This is called the decomposition of h2o2 in the human body. Google it you will be amazed. The reason the human body breaks down H2O2 in the body, is because it has enzymes in it  that catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 simply breaking it down and it does not enter your body as a free radical. ,almost every living thing that is exposed to oxygen simply breaks down H2O2 in the body.  However if you take in high grades of  H2O2 like what is used in rocket ships it will happen just as great ape says ,your body will not be able to break it down and what will happen is  h2o2 will steal  the electon from either the coppor or iron in your body once it does that it will look to return to its origanal state, to do that it has to take the electron from the cells in your body because they are on an axis destroying the cell.  Once it does that H2o2 will return to its original state and repeat this process up to a thound times</p>\n<p>Scientist and most doctors can get you to belive whatever you what to believe. They do not want to expose the truth to the whole world. It is Population control and will hurt the economy, affect the pharmacutical companies nobody will be buying cold meds. Doctors will lose a lot of buisness nobody will be getting sick. H2o2 cannot be taxed by the government the ingredients are natural too easy to access and it is too easy to make. They are wrong when the say it will not cure hiv/aids and other diseases it will however not cancer there are so many types of cancer there will never be 1 cure. I will explain this in a way you cannot deny it is the truth. it will cure any virus, viral infection, bacteria and fungus in your bloodstream. The reason is because there are 2 types of diseases anaerobic and aerobid skin and blood. Blood diseases thrive on a lack of oxygen skin disease thrive on oxyen, which makes skin diseases impossible to cure only treat because you cannot decrease the oxygen in the body you can only increase it.  There is already oxygen in your blood, but if you can increase this just a little bit it will kill everything this also means it will kill the good bacteria in your body and stomach .So you must do it in cycles stop for a while so your body can restore the good bacteria in your body and stomach that body naturally produces it.  If you keep continuously use H2O2 this will not happen leading to sickness and even death. This is one of the main reasons people die using H2o2. I must say the number 1 reason though is because they read crap on the interenet that is true, but don\u2019t learn how to properly do it because it is not explained.  They go buy H2o2 in the drug stores which has additives and stabalizers in it, you cannot use it you have to get it special made without. I must tell how to do it so this does not happen to anyone reading this site. Use 3% foodgrade not 35%, you can, but it would be hard to find the right ratio factor. Mix 1 tsp of 3% additive and stabalize free  into 1 gallon of water do this for 3 to 5 days then 2 tsp then 3tsp, then work down just like you worked up 3 then 2 then 1  then stop you have to wean off because your body gets used to the higher oxygen in the blood. You must do this on an emty stomach if not a superoxide anion will enter your body which is the worst free radical.  This is the only safe way recognized by me there is no other safe way.  you will hear a lot of rumors but if you are not 100% right about something, then keep your mouth shut untill you are.

Once it does that H2o2 will return to its original state and repeat this process up to a thound times</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=769#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-769\", \"769\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to the wiz kid'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-770\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>the wiz kid</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Jan 24, 2014</strong> @ 07:00:51\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-770\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>H2O2 will cure hiv/aids and other diseases it will however it will not cure  cancer there are so many types of cancer there will never be just  1 cure. I . it will cure any virus, viral infection including herpes, bacteria and fungus in your bloodstream. The reason is because there are 2 types of diseases anaerobic and aerobid skin and blood. Blood diseases thrive on a lack of oxygen skin disease thrive on oxyen, which makes skin diseases impossible to cure only treat because you cannot decrease the oxygen in the body you can only increase it.  There is already oxygen in your blood, but if you can increase this just a little bit it will kill everything this also means it will kill the good bacteria in your body and stomach .So you must do it in cycles stop for a while so your body can restore the good bacteria in your body and stomach that body</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=770#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-770\", \"770\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to the wiz kid'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-789\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=48' class='avatar avatar-48 avatar-default' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Anonymous</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Feb 07, 2014</strong> @ 11:42:32\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-789\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>So he provides links to kabal owned organization&#8217;s that suppress cheap cures while promoting chemo amd radiation which is no doubt horrible for humans.

I won&#8217;t post any for-or-against, you&#8217;ve had enough of that.</p>\n<p>I filled my dropper to 1ml, and counted how many drops came out of it. Approx 22 drops. Using some stoichiometry, I figured that half a ml of 35% peroxide in 250ml of water (which is very close to one cup) is 0.07% solution. Since the maximum dosage is twice that (22 drops), give or take a few drops, this means that the maximum recommended dosage is ~ 0.14%. This means that anyone taking the maximum dosage is well under one percent.</p>\n<p>When I looked up the toxicity, I couldn&#8217;t find much as far as official docs. Actually your links were the best on that. It was generally agreed that 10% is the border between bad idea and just stupid idea. I was curious because I wanted to try this myself, so why not find out for myself the dangers.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m not saying it helps or hurts as far as disease goes, but the percentage of solution does not strike me as anywhere near the danger area. </p>\n<p>If you can find research on 0.03% to 0.2% solutions, taken 1 hour before and 3 hours after meals, I&#8217;m very interested. Obviously I lean towards natural things, but I follow scientific process, and I don&#8217;t agree with anyone who doesn&#8217;t.

I&#8217;m currently on the protocol.  I&#8217;m on day 10.  </p>\n<p>So far, I&#8217;ve noticed an increased amount of energy, especially shortly after taking the (diluted) 35% HP.

Some work well, and with some I don&#8217;t notice much of a difference. </p>\n<p>While I appreciate any blog where someone has the courage to shares his/her thoughts, you come across quite defensive of such things you seem to know very little about.  I&#8217;ve read the blog up to this point.  It&#8217;s hardly encouraging to want to participate in a discussion like this when there is little credible follow-up in response to those who talk of their experience.  This matter of hydrogen peroxide is indicative on a large scale of how a person allows the experience of others to change him.  Instead of defending what sounds like a hollow position, I encourage you to seek answers beyond the mainstream corners of your attitude.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=822#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-822\", \"822\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to '>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-844\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6032c6876dc482d7a6169a956f791958?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Terrence</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Feb 27, 2014</strong> @ 10:48:26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-844\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>I think is the best response I have heard from you great ape thoughts &#8220;I\u2019m glad that I was able to educate at least one person about hydrogen peroxide. If you\u2019re still paying any attention to this little debate, please take this one piece of advice to heart. Don\u2019t blindly follow medical advice you find on the internet. Talk to a trusted doctor about any major changes to your medical regimen that you plan to make.&#8221; </p>\n<p>I recently bought the 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide but I have not used it yet because I still have an ill feeling about this &#8220;so-called&#8221; cure. I have heard a few testimonies that sounds &#8220;too good to be true&#8221;. </p>\n<p>One guy said that he used it for helping with his herpes sores then when he stop taking the solution, the sores returned. That doesn&#8217;t sound like a cure to me. (just stating the obvious)</p>\n<p>This discussion has me torn between the different views and I will keep researching this topic until I find something real. Now I&#8217;m clear about the using the 35% food grade version with the right dosage in the proper dilution of distilled water but there are still some uncertainties that have me scared to use it. Besides I don&#8217;t have any diseases so I&#8217;m not sure if I should be taking this anyways. So for now I am not convince of this &#8220;so called&#8221; cure and maybe that will change in the future. Surely if this method is approved by the FDA then I will be confident. I don&#8217;t want to hear any responses referring about &#8220;big pharm and profits&#8221; This is just my own opinion about what makes me feel safe. I want to be 100% sure what I am introducing into my body is approved. Well as close to 100% percent as possible lol.</p>\n<p>Terrence</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=844#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-844\", \"844\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Terrence'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-849\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/563d6f8c5d18a96906ee61ddf07a3a82?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Max the Mad</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Feb 27, 2014</strong> @ 23:52:30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-849\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Yet pumping people full of toxic chemicals is no problem?

I wish I had discovered it before I was diagnosed with cancer, but alas, there are a lot of what ifs.  So, I take food grade H202 in distilled water, following the strict instructions of the One Minute Cure and other literature, and have been taking it every day for 11 months, since a scan revealed my breast cancer had spread to my lungs and bones. The last scan a few months back showed there&#8217;s been no appreciable growth in the level of cancer cells in my body.   What was striking was that after six days of starting the protocol (back in May of last year), my mood felt strongly better.  I didn&#8217;t attribute it to the H202 at first because I had no expectations it would work.  But then my energy levels increased, I slept better, a noncontagious skin condition on the backs of my arms called keratosis pilarus disappeared (I&#8217;d had it since I was 16.  I&#8217;m now 51), and I haven&#8217;t had a cold or flu since.  Yes it can be a bit unsettling on the gut when you&#8217;re deep into the protocol and the dosage is high.  But I now do one glass a day, with 17 drops in it.  The thing is, so many commenters are warning of the dangers, but if you follow the protocol, ie distilled water, leaving several hours between ingesting food, it&#8217;s simple and easy and there&#8217;s no risk.  There&#8217;s no money in it for any pharmaceutical company to promote it.  Just seek out the appropriate literature, trust the fact that people used it liberally before drug companies pushed it out to the margins, and follow your own path.  I personally think it&#8217;s given me more time and for that I&#8217;m grateful.  It&#8217;s really been the most profound treatment of anything I&#8217;ve done for my cancer and thank god I had the guts to try it.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=1113#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-1113\", \"1113\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to Uppity'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-1177\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6ce182b295194a18056cb32515722c8f?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite>Dick</cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Apr 25, 2014</strong> @ 01:03:47\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-1177\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The medical and pharmaceutical professions use anecdotal evidence when it is to their advantage.

There is a leathal dose of everything.</p>\n<p>I am following the protocoll of drinking for now 12 days. I have been using steroides an my asthma fpr 32 Years! On day 6 of the protocol I simply forgot to take my Steroid! I needed it again the next day, primarilly because I could not believe it. 32 years form a deep habit! I will keep going!! Am currently down to one third of my normal dose of steroids.</p>\n<p>When my wife asked me about the danger, and that I should not put the 35% in the bathroom. My simple anwser was: Which of all of these bottles in the bath do contain anything you can drink? There were none!</p>\n<p>There is a good book an H2O2 from a german doctor summarizing the research done at Leipzig university  during the 60ths. They were using 35% as a mouthrinse, with great results on certain conditions. Try to put a drop of 35% on your finger. It will get white first and turn normal within a couple of hours. Same will happen in your mouth. It is not that dangerous. No need to flush with water. Still you should not drink 35% nor should you bath in it.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://greatapethoughts.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/drinking-hydrogen-peroxide-to-cure-disease/?replytocom=1321#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"commententry-1321\", \"1321\", \"respond\", \"165\" )' aria-label='Reply to cvgus'>Reply</a>\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-1355\">\n\t\t<p class=\"comment-author\">\n\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c540ba45744136a61698a8f5de246292?s=48&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D48&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' />\t\t\t<cite><a href='http://Google' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Franki</a></cite><br />\n\t\t\t<small>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>May 13, 2014</strong> @ 09:03:40\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"commententry\" id=\"comment-1355\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Great ape, how many cases of people do we have ,to have died of drinking hydrogen peroxide as per directions of the therapy?<br />\nDoctor great ape, there&#8217;s no cases !
