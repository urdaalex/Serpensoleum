body.  Due to our bad acidic diet, the pH of bodies are acidic.  My ORAL and urine pH was around 6.2.  Desired is 7.4.  Too high is 8.2+.  </p>\n<p>An acidic pH can occur from, an acid forming diet, emotional stress, toxic overload, and/or immune reactions or any process that deprives the cells of oxygen and other nutrients.  The body will try to compensate for acidic pH by using alkaline minerals.  If the diet does not contain enough minerals to compensate, a build up of acids in the cells will occur.</p>\n<p>An acidic balance will: decrease the body&#8217;s ability to absorb minerals and other nutrients, decrease the energy production in the cells, decrease it&#8217;s ability to repair damaged cells, decrease it&#8217;s ability to detoxify heavy metals, make tumor cells thrive, and make it more susceptible to fatigue and illness.  A BLOOD pH of 6.9, which is only slightly acidic, can induce coma and death.</p>\n<p>By taking 1-2 tsp of Maple Syrup/Baking Soda regularly, I can maintain oral and urine pH around 7.4-7.8.  This is the easiest way to boost pH in my body.  If you have problems digesting food due to chemo and high pH, take some digestive enzymes and probiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Maple Syrup/Baking Soda Trojan Horse</strong></p>\n<p>The sugar in the maple syrup is bounded with alkaline.  If cancer cells or germs take in the sugar, the hidden alkaline will weaken or destroy it. </p>\n<p>Trader Joe&#8217;s organic grade B maple syrup 3 parts.  Bob&#8217;s Red Mill baking soda 1 part (this is aluminum free unlike Arm &amp; Hammer).</p>\n<p>Heat the maple syrup to a warm temperature to dissolve the baking soda (this need not be at a boil).  Once warmed, stir in the baking soda for 5 minutes.  Example: 90 tsp syrup, 30 tsp baking soda.  Store this at room temperature.  Make enough for 10 days, beyond which mold may grow.</p>\n<p>The syrup/bicarbonate complex is brought into cancer cells or candida where it alters pH to uan unfavorable alkaline level.</p>\n<p>For cancer patients use 5-7 teaspoons per day divided.</p>\n<p>For candida or pH control use 3 teaspoons per day.</p>\n<p>Tasty alkalinization and good health.</p>\n<p>Thanks Dr. Ng</p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled\"><div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-6422084-107-581ea81bb8fdf' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/#blog_id=6422084&amp;post_id=107&amp;origin=truthpills.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=6422084-107-581ea81bb8fdf' data-name='like-post-frame-6422084-107-581ea81bb8fdf'><h3 class='sd-title'>Like this:</h3><div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'><span class='button'><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class='sd-text-color'></span><a class='sd-link-color'></a></div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"comments\">296 Responses to &#8220;Maple Syrup/Baking Soda Trojan&nbsp;Horse&#8221;</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"commentlist\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-122\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/caa0c5d6779852381ea4d37700c57353?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">beth yates</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-122\">\n\t2009/04/27 at 7:39 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>can i continue to keep using the baking soda &amp; maple syrup to help keep my body alkaline i have a good diet. i don&#8217;t eat sugar, white flour, or milk. i do in small amounts eat some cheese. i try to eat 70% 30% before i found the syrup &amp; soda i had a hard time staying ph ballanced. i just want to know if it&#8217;s ok if i keep using it.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=122#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-122\", \"122\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to beth yates'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-815\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34dcc1a228de19fc2360048169b5c637?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">D Porter</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-815\">\n\t2010/04/30 at 3:55 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>DJP  Protocol  &#8211; This is MY protocal \u201cthat worked for me\u201d in 8-09+. I am not providing medical advice, simply repeating my experience/protocol resulting in a sharp drop, to 0.1 PSA, &amp; staying (blood tests), to 4-10 &amp; no discomfort, etc.<br />\n\u201cNO\u201d Chemo or Radiation Minimum Drugs  (they are deadly to your immune system)</p>\n<p>Here is my 4-10 Protocol &#8211; Avoid any forms of sugar for a week+. Then Inititate as follows:<br />\n\u2022\t1st day- 1 Teaspoon of BS soda with 2 Teaspoons of Black Strap molasses (\u201cBSM\u201d) &amp; 1 cup room temp water 2x day.  Heat @ \u201cLOW\u201d temp for 5 minutes &amp; STIR a lot to fully combine your sugar &amp; BS into your \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d to benefit your body/immune system. The molasses or maple syrup targets cancer cells (which consume 15X more glucose than normal cells) &amp; the baking soda, (which is dragged into the cancer cell by the maple syrup/BSM), being very alkaline, forces a rapid shift in pH thereby killing the cancer cells fairly quickly (most say 24-48 hrs).   </p>\n<p>\u2022\t2nd day \u2013 repeat, also Do Deep breathing (30x &#8211; 3-10x day or more).  OXYGEN KILLS cancer cells<br />\n\u2022\t3rd day \u2013 same  Cancer cells gobble up SUGAR so when you encourage the intake of sugar it\u2019s like sending in a your own Trojan horse. The sugar is \u201cnot\u201d going to encourage the growth of the cancer colonies as the alkaline baking soda is going to kill the cells before they have a chance to grow.<br />\n\u2022\t4th day \u2013 same  2X day goal get to 8.0 &#8211; 8.5 pH &amp; hold 4-5 days &amp; result cancer cells dormant at pH 7.0-7.5+ or a few tenths, &amp; kills cancer cells @ 8.0-8.5.  My pH measured 8.3 on 3rd day with a blood &amp; urine test. </p>\n<p>\u2022\t5th day &#8211; started taking the solution &#8211; 2 tspns BS &amp; 2 Tsps BSM 2X day<br />\n\u2022\t6th day\u2013 reeat 2 Tspns BS &amp; 2 Tspn of BSM &amp; 1 cup of water 2x a day. My pH measured 8.25. That is what happens with cesium chloride/BS done by Italian Dr. Simoncini, mild nausea is good as it means the dead cancer cells are being dicarded by your body.<br />\n\u2022\t7th \u2013 All ok &#8211; lips tingled : an Oxygen Euphoria from a lot deep breathing. Oxygen assists in killing bone cancer! Also on day 7, increased BS to 3 Tspns. &amp; got a slight headache, backed off to 2 Tspns BS- I was a bit uncomfortable/nervous &amp; had a slight headache, so I reduced it.  At times I had slight confusion.</p>\n<p>\u2022\t8th day \u2013 double dose 3x a day to get pH high- could some be health issues with too much BS.  Potassium intake is important.<br />\n\u2022\t9th day \u2013 A little diarrhea, a little weak feeling, really began to up my potassium intake.

Sodium bicarbonate is safe, extremely inexpensive and unstoppably effective when it comes to cancer tissues. It&#8217;s an irresistible chemical, cyanide to cancer cells for it hits the cancer cells with a shock wave of alkalinity, which allows much more oxygen into the cancer cells than they can tolerate. Cancer cells cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen. Sodium bicarbonate is, for all intent and purposes, an instant killer of tumors. Full treatment takes only days.</p>\n<p>WHO IS TULLIO SIMONCINI?<br />\nTullio Simoncini (1951) is a roman doctor specialising in oncology, diabetology &amp; in metabolic disorders.<br />\nHe has a strong opposition to any type of intellectual conformity, which is often based on suppositions without foundation or worse, on lies &amp; falsities. He has a strong opposition to any type of intellectual conformity, which is often based on suppositions without foundation or worse, on lies and falsities. When, considering the total failure of official oncology, which is obvious to all, one can understand his strongly critical position of an Italian &amp; global medical system that operates in what is a scientific dead end that is of no help whatsoever to the patients. </p>\n<p>Dr. Simoncini cultivates sports &amp; takes care of his mind/body by following elementary natural rules such as a healthy diet, physical activity &amp; the practice of moral responsibility. He favorite sports are jogging, skiing &amp; soccer. His tendency to medical &amp; scientific synthesis also stems from a natural sensitivity that tends to perceive the harmony of the whole as distinct from the value of its constituent parts.  This quality is reinforced &amp; expressed by his propensity for music, &amp; cultivated by his practice of musical instruments such as piano &amp; classical and modern guitar. When a student in high school &amp; university, his musical abilities led him to form various musical bands that toured central Italy.</p>\n<p>Simoncini\u2019s personality is pervaded by a strong humanitarianism, which triggered him to reflect, because of  the impotence of medicine when faced by the pain of patients, on how little &amp; inadequate medicine\u2019s fundamental knowledge is. This empathy for the pain of others has been the constant motivator on the path of his personal life.  He\u2019s always travelling throughout the Italy to explain his theory in congresses, conferences &amp; interviews, &amp; to show how many patients healed from cancer.</p>\n<p>Dr. Simoncini discovered that the cause of this terrible illness is a fungus &amp; tried hard to persuade scientists how wrong are the actual theories on cancer. His therapy based on the strongest antifungal substance, sodium bicarbonate, is harmless &amp; very effective &amp; should be adopted all over the world</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=815#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-815\", \"815\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to D Porter'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-819\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f236d15fe866ab211fb78180be64056?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Wendy</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-819\">\n\t2010/05/11 at 12:02 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Dear D Porter,</p>\n<p>Thank you for this info.

Maybe I did something wrong, I don&#8217;t know. Instead of molasses I used organic maple syrup. I was on it for three weeks following your protocol as an example. Week two I maintained a ph level of 8.5 +. I experienced many of the same effects. No sugar before or during protocol. Lots of vegetables including vegie shakes. Supplements included magnesium (topical spray), selenium, iodide/iodine, potassium, co q-10, turmeric, cats claw etc. My PSA results came back yesterday. It jumped 2 1/2 points since the last test 3 months ago.  I feel like all I did was feed the cancer. I&#8217;m afraid to try it again. Can you offer any suggestions?

Regardless of the type of protocol you use, three weeks of protocol with comparisons of 3 month-span tests do not prove anything. Your PSA might have jumped many points for the first 2 months and the protocol might have move it back down to the 2 1/2 pts on your last PSA test.  You need to do a PSA test before the protocol and PSA test at the end of the protocol.  Then you can compare the two tests iff you keep as much of your diet and treatments the same.  Second, PSA tests are not perfect and small movements of PSA do not necessary mean changes to the tumor/cancer.  You need to continue monitoring your PSA levels.  Third, you need to move lymph.  This will detox your body by moving waste (toxin, acid, and etc.) out of your body.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8KnMP4IlA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8KnMP4IlA</a></p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-12428\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://i2.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/1467564212/picture?q=type%3Dlarge%26_md5%3D7106d9138c7cfd040f870700cc8d5510&#038;resize=32%2C32' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://www.facebook.com/Surrealist30' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>James Williams</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-12428\">\n\t2013/10/11 at 2:00 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>believe it or not Arm and Hammer is aluminum free!</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-821\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34dcc1a228de19fc2360048169b5c637?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">D Porter</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-821\">\n\t2010/05/11 at 10:01 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"mailto:djpsail@gmail.com\">djpsail@gmail.com</a></p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=821#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-821\", \"821\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to D Porter'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-3 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-963\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34dcc1a228de19fc2360048169b5c637?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">D Porter</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-963\">\n\t2010/11/01 at 11:13 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Smaller amounts is preferred with no cancer   To high a pH is not good</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-9428\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/200ad860be0af38d91481d932c0a261e?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">J C Sysk</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9428\">\n\t2013/01/05 at 1:28 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Maple syrup and bicarbonate of soda cold mix.

I consume two teaspoon several times a week and check my pH.  </p>\n<p>If your pH level is too high (8.2+), it might affect your digestion over time.  The high pH will affect your stomach acid.  So, avoid taking it with your meal.  People who have heartburns and digestion problems actually have too low stomach acid, so taking pharma drugs to lower stomach acid will make the situation much worse over time.  This has happened to me.  After taking probiotics daily for about 6 months had really helped with my severe heartburn.

Every pH higher or lower is a factor of 10, e.g. If you drink Pepsi at 2.49 pH, that&#8217;s almost 4 zeros or 10,000 times are acidic (and causes cancer) than pure water.  In order to neutralize the soda, probably alkaline water at pH 11.  If you drink diet soda, it will contain either aspartame or sucralose and both was very poisonous.  In the long term, people will develop cancer and most likely brain cancer.  Sugar is not good for you but high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, and sucralose are far worse for you.   </p>\n<p>I cut out soda and enjoy some slightly acidic foods along with my maple syrup bicarbonate.

The amount of maple syrup bicarbonate you take is up to you.   Check your pH level with some inexpensive pH testing strip/tape.  For optimal health, your body should be around 7.3.  If you have parasites or cancer to eliminate, you will need to increase it.</p>\n<p>I personally like to eat pasta and meat so the maple syrup bicarbonate is a good way to balance my pH.  The amount of food (calories) I eat determines my weight.  I can eat a lot of food for several weeks, I can gain 15-20 pounds.

Sodium bicarbonate is safe, extremely inexpensive and unstoppably effective when it comes to cancer tissues. It&#8217;s an irresistible chemical, cyanide to cancer cells for it hits the cancer cells with a shock wave of alkalinity, which allows much more oxygen into the cancer cells than they can tolerate. Cancer cells cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen. Sodium bicarbonate is, for all intent and purposes, an instant killer of tumors. Full treatment takes only days, as does another cancer treatment that heats the cancer cells with laser generated heat. (At bottom see combining ph shift with heat.)<br />\nThe extracellular (interstitial) pH (pHe) of solid tumours is significantly more acidic compared to normal tissues [2].<br />\nCase one: A patient diagnosed with pulmonary neoplasm of the lung, underwent treatment with sodium bicarbonate, before submitting to surgery to remove part of the lung. Treatment consisted of sodium bicarbonate administered orally, by aerosol, and IV. After first treatment reduction of nodules and absorption was evident, and after 8 months was no longer visible at all. Treatments also reduced size of the liver and results were confirmed by both X-ray and CAT scan.</p>\n<p>&amp;<br />\n     Dr. Jim Howenstine had to move to Costa Rica due to threats harassment from AMA &amp; Drug cos.<br />\n&amp;</p>\n<p>Cancer Tutor</p>\n<p>Also</p>\n<p> Jim Kelmun \u2013 a 75 year old former truck driver, has been preparing remedies to assist cancer sufferers since 1954.

I started out with 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of blackstrap molasses and one cup of water. Not warmed or heated water. Just room temperature. Next day \u2013 same thing. Third day \u2013 same thing. Fourth day \u2013 same thing. I am feeling fine and decide to up the dose.</p>\n<p>Day six \u2013 still 2 teaspoons of baking soda with 2 teaspoons of molasses and 1 cup of water twice a day.</p>\n<p>On day seven I got aggressive and increased the baking soda dosage to 3 teaspoons. This brought on a slight headachy feeling. I backed off to 2 teaspoons baking soda because I was getting a little nervous. Also, my headache was getting stronger. I vacillated between continuing with the higher dose or not. I really wanted to kill it.

Also, can I leave it on the counter for a few days, just as I could the maple syrup recipe?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Wendy<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.GlobalInformationNetwork.com/?AffiliateCode=WendyKGin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.GlobalInformationNetwork.com/?AffiliateCode=WendyKGin</a></p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=676#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-676\", \"676\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Wendy Kraft'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-6098\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b0fa8bd19fe6333d0410a32b32db69dc?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Deb</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-6098\">\n\t2012/06/23 at 12:56 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Would this be safe for a diabetic person to use to fight candida?</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=6098#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6098\", \"6098\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Deb'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-677\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/edf4941586eee106eec05eb6977ad793?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Tamara</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-677\">\n\t2009/10/29 at 4:32 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>I used the three to one mixture of maple syrup and baking soda and heated it for five minutes.

I normally heat and stirred for about 5 minutes.  If I cook with higher heat and/or longer time, it gets thicker or even hardens.  The mixture doesn&#8217;t taste great but it&#8217;s not bad.   You can adjust the heat and or time to get the right taste, texture, and thickness to suit your taste buds.</p>\n<p>After five minutes, I think the sugar and baking soda should be bounded one way or another.   I  can&#8217;t prove it but I can keep my body pH consistently around 7.5-8.    With maple syrup bicarbonate, sun (30 minutes per day) or vitamin D3, and vitamin c, and low sugar diet have really kept me from getting colds and flus for many years.  No more pharma drugs and bioweapon vaccines needed as they will give people cancer decades down the road.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=699#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-699\", \"699\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to truthpills'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-710\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/81610289df83a799d809f392ba9c17f3?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Dave</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-710\">\n\t2009/11/26 at 10:09 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>The same thing happened to me.

The question is how can you tell if the baking soda is completely bonded.  If they are all bonded and still more sugar left, then you might try adding more baking soda.  I&#8217;ve been told by several cancer patients that it has helped a lot.  I was able to maintain a pH of 7-8 throughout most of the day.  I noticed that my liver inflammation is well controlled.

While sodium bicarbonate does raise the pH and will very likely to kill cancer cells and germs because cancer cells and germs cannot live in a high pH environment.  I think the rate of cancer reduction would be different.  It takes longer time to convert all the anaerobic cells back to normal cells.   Have you read Cancer: Step outside of the box by by Ty M.

I pour the water over the b. soda/honey mixture and stir constantly to melt the mixture into the water and make a tea.  Initially the &#8220;tea&#8221; is white, but I leave it sit for about 5 minutes and it becomes clearer.  I drink it when it is cool enough to drink without burning my mouth.  I drink this at least twice per day on an empty stomach; AM and PM.  I think the AM drink is more effective because I have essentially done a fasting since my last meal the night before and during the night and whatever is desired to be killed inside the body is really &#8220;hungry&#8221; for the glucose/sugar.  I also drink 1/8 teaspoon baking soda in a 16 ounce glass of water throughout the day, especially with my meals to counter the acidity of my meals.  You need the increased water intake to flush out the toxins/die off debris out of the body.  NOTE:  I read that it is necessary to monitor/take potassium supplements when doing the baking soda/maple syrup/honey/blackstrap molasses recipe because the body&#8217;s potassium will become displaced in the body causing a potassium deficiency; reportedly one banana provides 500mg of potassium.  Look up potassium deficiency symptoms to be aware of this possible occurrence.  Take care.  Be happy and healthy.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=752#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-752\", \"752\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to julie'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-truthpills bypostauthor even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-759\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34f108c89ca30d4fb8b9f31e46dc17b6?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">truthpills</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-759\">\n\t2010/01/27 at 5:03 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>I do not recommend heating or boiling water using a microwave.

Could I please make just one note that could assist you with your overall health.  Please get rid of your microwave.  I lived in a house full of alternative wellness providers and we still had a microwave.  I actually got it because it was also a convection oven and explained to the others that I didn&#8217;t want them to use the microwave feature. I could feel an energetic shift in me every time someone used it.  To support these findings an article came out to educate the public about what happens to nutrients when heated with microwaves and what happens to our bodies when we are exposed to microwaves while cooking.  The article was in Common Ground magazine sometime in /85.  Our roommate Henry Dorst was among many other things a Kinesiologist and he did double-blind experiments with all of us.  Our home was 4,000 sq feet so we had a lot of space to work with.  The short of it was there was no distance or floor level in the house that could keep the microwaves from negativy affecting everyone.  Our age range was 12yrs- 67 and about equal male to female.  By muscle testing we all found that this microwave (top of the line as well) was causing negative effects in each person in a different way.  Some tested for memory fog or confusion, some for muscular weakness and others felt an emotional component that seemed to be linked to the endocrine system resulting in depression or moodiness.  The 12 year old and I let this box of technical convenience sit in the garage for a week or so and then we gutted the offender and made it into a breadbox. I must admit we did have fun watching unsuspecting visitors surprised at finding bread in the micro and after they&#8217;d removed and pushed the appropriate buttons it didn&#8217;t work.  Ok so that&#8217;s my personal stand in a house we shared but this is my Mother&#8217;s story.  When she lived alone like a lot of elderly they are heating up left over or tea and coffee all the darn time. Within a years time of this micro she began behaving oddly.  When she had her autopsy done there was 1/10 of her brain missing in the frontal lobe.  They called it a rare dementia.  What they didn&#8217;t say is that people who stand in front of the microwave drumming their fingers on the counter top impatient for the bell to ring are exposing their wee brains to the waves.  These waves scramble nutrient codings so that the body will do what it can to assemble digestion but in the end the milon sheathing on the nerves will fray and information both cognitive and internal will skip over the frays and loose information as it skips.  Viola dementia or any other sign of memory loss in the elderly especially.  Now doctors know this or they would not have stopped using microwaves to heat up infant formula in the hospitals.  Babies were showing quick signs of malnutrition because milk is their only food.  Imagine the elderly who limit their food variety over time.  Same thing.<br />\nSo with love and concern for yours and everyone else\u2019s health please use a pot to heat all things and kick that micro to the curb because if you believe that pharmas do not have your health improvement in mind neither do corporations that addict consumers to so many technologies that without a doubt damages our ability to have healthy immune responses and a body that will be disease free for a life time.<br />\nFelicia</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=4870#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-4870\", \"4870\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to silvermoondolphin'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-806\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/07b70986ff8d5fb820bce7446a1526c0?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Wong Yu Chung</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-806\">\n\t2010/04/14 at 7:20 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Hi Dr Ng:</p>\n<p>Is it advisable for a person with hypertension to use baking soda for a cure?</p>\n<p>THANK YOU.

This is why people use lysine as a treatment for herpes simplex or chicken pox/shingles.  Lysine antagonizes arginine.</p>\n<p>This also applies to the amino acid citrulline, which forms in to arginine.</p>\n<p>There are much safer ways to lower blood pressure.  What works best depends on the cause of the high blood pressure.  Magnesium malate though will work in the majority of cases since it works like a natural calcium channel blocker.  For the same reason it should not be taken with calcium.  Ashwagandha is a natural ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Sterols from jiaogulan relax blood vessels and the weak cardiac glycosides from coleus forskohlii will relax blood vessels while slowing and strengthening the heart muscle.</p>\n<p>In response to Lady&#8217;s question, you cannot alter the body&#8217;s pH easily.

This man does very thorough research and is quite driven to show us how to reign in health. </p>\n<p>Just a few days ago, I switch the time I take the molasses and baking soda.<br />\nI did not know it at the time, but the time of day I chose was, according to him,one of the times of day that the most growth hormone is naturally released. At the time of this switch is when I began seeing the most dramatic results on a daily basis, all in line with results Dr Buttar is seeing with the natural growth hormone release. Hmmm.</p>\n<p>[He lives only three hours from me and I have met him. I look forward to speaking with him directly about this myself. However, today is the last day of a big literary push for him. He is pushing his new book, &#8220;The 9 Steps to Keep the Doctor Away&#8221; to the Best Seller List so he will be in a certain class, able to take on the drug pushers in a full-force challenge on the top media channels. So, I thought I would put it out here for feedback.]</p>\n<p>This guy&#8217; s work is amazing. I have seen on video autistic children, &#8220;walking out of autism&#8221; on film.

I like now. I have absolutely no problem with the flavor. This could be because I have learned to be a good girl and stand at the stove with no distractions. I stir it constantly, without stop. I stir it until the reaction ceases and then just a moment more. I have the burner on low. This process takes about 12-15 minutes. </p>\n<p>My favorite time to take it is right before bed. The first night, it kept me up a bit as my mind was quite active, regardless of the fact that I was fall-over sleepy right before taking it. However, I slept more deeply and with more REM sleep than I had in a long time&#8230;and I thought  my sleep pattern was pretty good already!</p>\n<p>I awake ready to go. The groggy, &#8220;Just let me be alone for an hour&#8221; feeling is gone. (My husband likes this)! Actually, I awake as if I had never gone to sleep. I guess that is what they call, &#8220;Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I started taking it at bedtime to avoid the starvation feeling I had when I was taking it full-strength before. I figured I could not eat myself out of house and home in my sleep. I think I am right, but we found a bite taken out of the refrigerator door this morning! </p>\n<p>In reality, this hunger feeling (desire for more protein), the deeper sleep, the no more soreness after even the most extreme exercise, and the more youthful appearance coming on are all similar to results one doctor has seen with those that have incurred a natural increase in endogenous Human Growth Hormone (hGH your own body creates), while consistently decreasing IGF levels.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, according to this doctor, there are four times a day when the body releases more hGH. Bedtime is the second best time I believe.  I am loving the added results I am seeing by switching to bedtime (and 7:30Am).</p>\n<p>Could there be a correlation between the results I am seeing with the Molasses/baking soda protocol and the results Dr. Buttar is seeing in his patients?</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=854#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-854\", \"854\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Wendy Kraft'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-9680\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9cb6aca894ee0c948d05e26624775ce6?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Thomas R</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9680\">\n\t2013/02/03 at 9:14 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Ma&#8217;am,<br />\nPerhaps you have learned from PBS-TV that Carbo-hydrate-Digestion becomes slow during Slumber, thus inducing intoxication &#8212;<br />\nMore info. is in note # 108 @</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9646\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9646</a></p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=9680#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-9680\", \"9680\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Thomas R'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-874\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a70b118f3f52b2b1238e83de8ea1e9a3?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Betty</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-874\">\n\t2010/08/01 at 9:20 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>I have a question regarding what type of cookware/utensils can be used in preperation of SB and Black Strap Molasses.

Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, thus there are no aluminum atoms.  Some baking powders, which is what people are confusing with baking soda does contain aluminum.  Regardless the whole aluminum danger thing is way over hyped. The supposed link between aluminum and Alzheimer&#8217;s was disproven decades ago.  And many people don&#8217;t realize that since aluminum is so prevalent in the Earth&#8217;s crust that nearly every plant we consume contains aluminum. Since animals also eat these same plants the animals we eat also contain aluminum.  If aluminum was as toxic as some claim then the whole population of the Earth would have been in serious trouble since the time humans first set foot on Earth.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=14293#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-14293\", \"14293\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to James'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-893\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/34dcc1a228de19fc2360048169b5c637?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://djpsail@gmail.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Don</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-893\">\n\t2010/08/19 at 11:14 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Good Morning:<br />\nYour cancer is curable !<br />\nThere are a few &#8220;ifs&#8221; that you must commit to.

They are fictional characters on The A-Team and Battlestar Galactica (1978). But both were played by Dirk Benedict who cured his cancer with a plant based diet that included seaweed. Wikipedia says &#8220;Benedict was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was told that the cure would be castration.&#8221; That was in 1975 since that is when he wrote his book about it called Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy.

In his best-selling book \u201cRecalled by Life\u201d, he told how he adopted a low-fat, Macrobiotic diet and far outlived the grave prognosis he had been given. The diet he followed is called &#8220;Macrobiotic&#8221; which is drawn from the best elements of a traditional Asian diet, including generous amounts of rice, whole grains, vegetables, beans, &amp; nuts, . NO \u2013oil, sugar, flour, fish, fruit, &amp; all organic food only.

Or is everything already in motion?<br />\nAnswer: China Study -T. Colin Campbell &#8211; Yes, a variety of evidence shows that cancers &amp; non-cancers alike can be stopped even after consuming a poor diet earlier in life. This effect is equivalent to treatment, a very exciting concept.<br />\nKF: This is sounding like it&#8217;s a cure for cancer; is that the case?<br />\nDr. T. Colin Campbell- YES The problem in this area of medicine is that traditional drs. are so focused on the use of targeted therapies (chemo, surgery, radiation, drugs) that they refuse to even acknowledge the use of therapies like nutrition &amp; are loathe to even want to do proper research in this area. So, in spite of the considerable evidence-theoretical &amp; practical-to support a beneficial nutritional effect, every effort will be made to discredit it. It&#8217;s a self-serving motive.<br />\nKF: What else do you recommend one does to avoid, stop, or reverse cancer?<br />\nTCC: A good diet, when coupled with other health promoting activities like exercise, adequate fresh air &amp; sunlight, good water &amp; sleep, will be more beneficial.

In this series of interviews I&#8217;ve conducted with extraordinary nutritional researchers &amp; medical doctors, I&#8217;ve sought to understand the link between diet &amp; the most common &amp; dreaded diseases that are prevalent in our culture. What I&#8217;m hearing over &amp; over is that a plant based diet is both preventative &amp; healing, whereas a diet high in animal protein is destructive to our health &#8211; this is the case with cancer, type 2 diabetes, &amp; heart disease</p>\n<p>What I, Don Porter, am about to say is EXTRAORDINARY, REVOLUTIONARY &amp; to me UTTERLY ASTOUNDING   It is also accurate &amp; legally proper, based upon my supporting data/documents &amp; statements by significant others.

I am doing this for continuity sake. </p>\n<p>I had trouble with the recipe at first. I had forgotten a detail or too. Also, I needed to adjust to the taste, once I had the recipe right. Had I done things right from the start, I would already have been off the recipe for a while now, then back on, off etc. I would have carried this pattern on so that my body could clear out the recipe and be ready for more without making any kind of imbalance, unrenowned to me.</p>\n<p>However, that is not how things worked out. I am still getting fantastic results, but I need to clear something out before I stop for a bit. I will eat a banana today, apricots tomorrow, sunflower seeds and raisins the next day to keep my potassium level up in spite of the sodium intake I am incurring with the baking soda.</p>\n<p>I do not mix with water. I just keep the 1 part baking soda and 3 parts molasses mixture in the fridge in a wide, small jar. I take it out 3 times daily. I dip a dessert fork into it and twirl the tip of the fork in the mixture. I take the fork out, twirling it like while eating spaghetti. I eat this in one \u201cbite\u201d but I let it sit in my mouth for a few seconds before swallowing. I do this because digestion of sugars begins in the mouth. For me, this is the most simple, doable method. I have no excuses like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to mix it with water or time to drink something. It could also go in a little cooler if I were to head out for the day as most folks do.</p>\n<p>I have also left the mixture out, on top of the fridge. However, when I did this, the baking soda sunk to the bottom, especially in the summer. As well, it more easily dripped on my shirt!</p>\n<p>At two times a day, I was feeling good and seeing great results that I will not enumerate here. At 3 times a day, I still felt good, but was getting heat surges, sort of similar to heat flashes.  I was also \u201cStarving all day\u201d. For which I was not prepared, organic grocery-wise. So, I backed down to two times daily.</p>\n<p>As of this last week, I am now seeing all the benefits I know of when our own endogenous growth hormones are naturally released. Hmmm, could there be a correlation?</p>\n<p>Here is where I will place my past posts:</p>\n<p>2.\tI am now up to the full ratio of 1 cup molasses to 1/3 cup baking soda. I like it now. I have absolutely no problem with the flavor. This could be because I have learned to be a good girl and stand at the stove with no distractions. I stir it constantly, without stop. I stir it until the reaction ceases and then just a moment more. I have the burner on low. This process takes about 5-10 minutes.<br />\nMy favorite time to take it is right before bed. The first night, it kept me up a bit as my mind was quite active, regardless of the fact that I was fall-over sleepy right before taking it. However, I slept more deeply and with more REM sleep than I had in a long time\u2026and I thought my sleep pattern was pretty good already!<br />\nI awake ready to go. The groggy, \u201cJust let me be alone for an hour\u201d feeling is gone. (My husband likes this as I am much better company now than before)! Actually, I awake as if I had never gone to sleep. I guess that is what they call, \u201cBright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\u201d<br />\nI started taking it at bedtime to avoid the starvation feeling I had when I was taking it full-strength before. I figured I could not eat myself out of house and home in my sleep. I think I am right, but we found a bite taken out of the refrigerator door this morning!<br />\nIn reality, this hunger feeling (desire for more protein), the deeper sleep, the no more soreness after even the most extreme exercise, and the more youthful appearance coming on are all similar to results one doctor has seen with those that have incurred a natural increase in endogenous Human Growth Hormone (hGH your own body creates), while consistently decreasing IGF levels.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, according to this doctor, there are four times a day when the body releases more hGH: 7:30AM, after lunchtime, Bedtime and one other time that I have forgotten.<br />\nCould there be a correlation between the results I am seeing with the Molasses/baking soda protocol and the results this doctor is seeing in his patients?<br />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />\n1. I am seeing results similar to what one of this nations top doctor\u2019s says happens in the body when Growth Hormone is naturally and safely released. This man does very thorough research and is quite driven to show us how to reign in health.<br />\nJust a few days ago, I switched the time I take the molasses and baking soda.<br />\nI did not know it at the time, but the time of day I chose was, according to him,one of the times of day that the most growth hormone is naturally released. At the time of this switch is when I began seeing the most dramatic results on a daily basis, all in line with results he is seeing with the natural growth hormone release. Hmmm.<br />\n[He lives only three hours from me and I have met him. I look forward to speaking with him directly about this myself. This guy\u2019 s work is amazing. I have seen on video autistic children, \u201cwalking out of autism\u201d on film. I cannot wait to share the results I am seeing with him and to share this approach with him.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=898#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-898\", \"898\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Wendy'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-9666\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9cb6aca894ee0c948d05e26624775ce6?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Thomas R</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9666\">\n\t2013/02/02 at 9:32 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>During slumber, carbo-hydrates are not fully digested by middle-aged people, who do not have enough of the &#8220;amylase&#8221; Enzyme<br />\n(&#8211;Dr. Brenda Watson, CNC = Clinical Nutritionist, Certified [?] on PBS-TV, author of &#8220;The Detox Strategy,&#8221; etc.).</p>\n<p>This is a Chemo-Therapy because it causes normal Cells&#8217; Mitochondria to lose Energy. _ Cells die via a Gene (&#8220;P-53&#8221;) if you have enough Vitamin B-9 = Folic Acid (&#8211;Dr. Michael Roizen on PBS), &amp; intra-venous Ascorbic Acid has repressed Cancer &#8212; references @ Note # 109.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=9666#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-9666\", \"9666\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Thomas R'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-928\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a46c4a3c51891619524c50daab1c87eb?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Diane</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-928\">\n\t2010/09/21 at 9:21 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>I have candidiasis and I took this formula for the first time last night&#8211;(went to a LOT of trouble finding the Bob&#8217;s Red Mill bs).

Caldwell Esselstyn &amp; Dean Ornish &#8211; What the Interview Didn&#8217;t Have Time to Explain about How to Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease with a Plant-Based Diet</p>\n<p>President Bill Clinton is on a plant-based diet from Dr. Esselstyn &amp; Dr. Ornish<br />\nWolf Blitzer Interviews Esselstyn &amp; Ornish &#8211; the Doctors Who Influenced Bill Clinton&#8217;s Heart Disease Reversal Diet- Sept. 24, 2010<br />\nYesterday my husband &amp;I had the pleasure of watching Drs. Esselstyn &amp; Ornish explain on national TV just how a Plant-based diet can prevent or reverse heart disease.  Only, 9 minutes can&#8217;t do it justice.  So here&#8217;s the rest of the story.    As we watched, we enjoyed an amazing homemade whole wheat cheese-less pizza topped with kalamata olives, fresh basil, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, &amp; artichoke hearts&#8211;that took just minutes to put together!<br />\nSept. 2004: Bill Clinton has quadruple bypass surgery to repair blocked arteries after experiencing chest pain.<br />\nFeb. 10, 2010:  Clinton has 2 stents placed in one of his previously-treated arteries, after one of his bypass grafts completely closed up.  According to his MD, Clinton had &#8220;toed the line&#8221; adhering to diet, exercise &amp; medical therapy<br />\nSpring, 2010:  The stents fail to prevent further cardiovascular blockages. This is not an unusual occurrence. Clinton decides to read the medical literature about preventing and reversing heart disease.  He discovers that there is only one one way to do this&#8211;a strict plant-based diet loaded with green leafy vegetables, and without meat, chicken, fish, dairy, or added oils.  The two physician&#8217;s who are pioneers in this treatment approach are Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn and Dr. Dean Ornish.  Clinton decides to conduct his own personal clinical trial.<br />\nDr.E sselstyn- Zero cardiovascular events have occurred in Dr. Esselstyn&#8217;s original group of 17 compliant patients that he has followed for over the past 25 years.  Esselstyn continues to work with hundreds of other patients who have similar success stories.  There is no mortality, no morbidity, no expense from following a plant-based diet&#8211;if you eat in a way that makes the cap over your plaque super strong!  Like most Americans, Wolf Blitzer didn&#8217;t seem to understand why bypass surgery or stents cannot cure cardiovascular disease. These procedures only treat emergency blockages.  And statins are no guarantee that it won&#8217;t happen again.  Too bad Dr. Esselstyn didn&#8217;t have a chance to tell Blitzer this:<br />\n&#8220;Some people think the &#8220;diet&#8221; is extreme.  Half a million people a year will have their chests opened up and a vein taken from their leg and sewn onto their coronary artery.  Some people would call that extreme.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;The elephant in the room when we talk about stents and bypass surgery&#8211;those procedures don&#8217;t protect from new heart attacks.   Stents &amp; bypasses are used to treat large arterial blockages.  Yet according to many research studies only a small percentage of heart attacks are caused by the largest build-up of plaque.  The rest are caused by the more numerous newer blockages that are far more inflamed and much more likely to rupture than the larger older, more stable plaques.  So this is why those procedures don&#8217;t treat  the disease.  They are treating the symptoms.  </p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a Dr. &amp; I have not had any medical training.

I have jsut been told got lung cancer and would like to hear more re positive outcomes and would like to know more about nebulisinbg with sodium bicarbonate. I am going to give it a go but I am also having an all aout attack (maybe) am seeing thoracic surgeon tomorrow (wot a xmas gift i got hey).  i am 64 and am not really sure which way to go yet.  been eating apricot kernels and tons of rasberries for the ellagic aCid.  also taking iodine and have bought the bicarb which i initially did to take with arginine but then i read that in some cases arginine encourages growth of tumors.  I have spent literally days on the net and met some cross   people , or rather people who reacted     crossly when i pointed out for instance that dr sartori is known as dr death in australia after several deaths using cesium therapy (maybe he forgot to give them potassium), so I think it makes good sense to ask your question. i have found that the iodine has made me very calm and cheerful in spite of my bad news.

This is most likely due to the strong osmotic shift this would cause, which can kill healthy cells as well as cancer cells.  Cancer cells already have an internal pH more alkaline than healthy cells.  Therefore, trying to alkalize cancer cells is not going to kill them since it is the internal alkalinity that leads to the conversion of healthy cells in to cancer cells and that allows cancer cells to survive and thrive. Here is part of a post I did on a YouTube video in response to some false claims being made in the comments about ionized water being helpful.  I show the evidence against cancer being caused by acids or cancer cells being acidic:</p>\n<p>&#8220;ffect on blood pH.</p>\n<p>Secondly, elevated acidity DOES NOT cause cancer or acid reflux.</p>\n<p>Cancer for example, thrives due to alkalinity.

Br Med Bull. 1999;55(3):578-92</p>\n<p>Neutralizing stomach acid also increases the risk of cancer causing pathogens taking hold in the body rather than being destroyed as normal by stomach acid. The cancer causing pathogen H. pylori for example secretes highly alkaline ammonia to protect itself from the stomach acid.  H. pylori is not the only pathogen though killed by acidity and promoted by alkalinity.  Many pathogens, especially cancer causing pathogens thrive in an alkaline environment and are destroyed by acids.</p>\n<p>Another problem with neutralizing stomach acid in cancer patients is that cancer patients suffer from and die from cachexia, which is exacerbated by a lack of stomach acidity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Be very careful with iodine as well.  I have written extensively on the dangers of excess iodine and just had a friend die last year from excess iodine.  The safe upper limit for iodine is only 150mcg (MICROgrams) per day.  There are people on the internet offering very dangerous advice of taking 50-300mg (milligrams) of iodine daily. When people report having adverse effects to these toxic levels of iodine they tell them they are suffering from a &#8220;bromine detox&#8221;, which is complete BS.  Then they tell them to take a salt flush to get rid of the bromine, when it is really getting rid of the excess iodine from the salt. After than they tell these people to then take even higher doses of iodine, which forces the thyroid in to a hypothyroid state eliminating the hyperthyroid symptoms initially caused by the excess iodine all so they can sell more iodine.  Quite a dangerous scam they got going:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://medcapsules.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=2485\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://medcapsules.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=2485</a></p>\n<p>Small amounts of iodine can help in SOME cases of cancer since iodine is an estrogen antagonist.  Therefore, it can help in cases of estrogen sensitive cancers.  On the other hand excess iodine can aggravate Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroidosis and can induce hypothyroidism.  These in turn elevate inflammatory homocysteine, which is a big risk factor for cancer.</p>\n<p>As for cesium chloride, this crap is worthless and very dangerous.  I have been working on writing a book on holistic cancer therapies explaining what actually works such as ozone and some herbs, and what is complete quackery such as &#8220;oleander soup&#8221; and cesium chloride.  I did an entire chapter on cesium chloride explaining the flaws in the science and bogus hype such as areas of the world where cesium is high in the water the cancer rates are lower.  If we look at the actual cancer rates in these places per capita we find that the cancer rates are as high if not higher than in the U.S.  If you look t Santori&#8217;s &#8220;research&#8221; you find that most of his references are his own writings because nobody else has ever verified his so-called &#8220;research&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Other things to keep in mind with cesium chloride is that cesium chloride has been shown to highly clastogenic in high doses and thus cancer causing.  In low doses cesium chloride has been shown to stimulate cellular proliferation, which cancer cells are already doing. </p>\n<p>Cesium chloride is also well known for causing heart related issues and liver toxicity.</p>\n<p>The heart related issues can be offset with the administration of potassium, but if you read Santori&#8217;;s research his premise was to starve cancer cells by REDUCING serum potassium since potassium stimulates insulin release.  Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of glucose by cells including cancer cells.  Therefore, taking potassium supplements with cesium chloride would be counterproductive to the concept Santori presents.</p>\n<p>Even if cesium chloride inhibited glucose uptake by cancer cells though this would not make a difference since cancer cells can use other fuel sources including lactate, amino acids and ketones.</p>\n<p>Again I have a whole long chapter on the various false premises behind cesium chloride therapy.  Its nothing more than complete quackery.</p>\n<p>The most effective and safest therapy I have yet found for cancer is ozone therapy.  Here is a write up I did on the subject:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.medcapsules.com/info/The%20Chemistry%20of%20Ozone%20Therapy%20on%20Cancer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.medcapsules.com/info/The%20Chemistry%20of%20Ozone%20Therapy%20on%20Cancer.htm</a></p>\n<p>And more information on ozone:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://medcapsules.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=354\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://medcapsules.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=354</a></p>\n<p>I do not sell ozone units so don&#8217;t anyone write to me asking.  And I don&#8217;t have recommendations.  I prefer cold corona machines for therapy.  Problem is that I have seen several companies claim their units were cold corona when they were actually hot corona.  I cannot tell which they are without looking at the inside, how they were designed.  Most manufacturers though are not going to let you open up their machines to see how their machine was designed so you are stuck taking the word of the sales site.  I have always built my own in part for this reason.  And in the one link above I do give instructions on how to build a cold corona system.</p>\n<p>Here is another article I wrote that also discusses the use of herbs for cancer:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.medcapsules.com/info/Cancer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.medcapsules.com/info/Cancer.htm</a></p>\n<p>James</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-16366\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9662c564b71097b793ed1355bf4e289?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Clays Etc</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-16366\">\n\t2014/05/30 at 11:55 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Friday, May 30, 2014<br />\n5:23 PM</p>\n<p>Someone ask for a report from someone that has used MS and BS as a cure for cancer.</p>\n<p>I had colon cancer and had 1/3 of my colon removed, did the chemo thing for a while and quit because it was killing me (literally) found the MSBS thing on the web and figured that I had nothing to lose, it was just food.</p>\n<p>I could not get the MS to mix with the BS so I switched to Honey and BS, it will mix completely cold but go with a big container as it will foam up</p>\n<p>For three weeks a spoon full morning and nite, then three weeks of high dose of vitamin C and ACV.

I beat it &amp;  have had many people contact me requesting data on how I did it, &amp; Ty Bollinger asked me to share my success story with his readers. Well, here it is, &amp; to keep it simple, I utilized my underappreciated, in this society, Immune System that, basically, is the same as everyone else\u2019s.  Therefore, what I accomplished &#8211; so can YOU !<br />\nAfter the rather significant overdose of medical negativeness I concentrated on what is possible, having studied Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, David Williams, Tony Robbins, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Weil, M.D., Dr. Julian Whitaker, Verne Varona, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr.,  Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. T. Colin Campbell (China Study), Ruan Jin Zhao, Ph.D., O.M.D, L.A.c. &amp; re-read my version of a bible, \u201cConfession of a Kamikaze Cowboy\u201d by Dirk Benedict.  Dirk earned a bit of notoriety/fame from his participation in the A-Team, Battlestar Gallactica, Charlie\u2019s Angels, Living Well Naturally ny Dr. Anthony J. Sattilaro, etc. I determined that we all enjoy a body that is a miraculous machine that must be aligned properly with a quality diet, exercise, quality liquids, deep breathing, organic foods, &amp; minimum stress, in a FAST paced society, along with some occasional \u201cTLC\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u2022\tIf we don\u2019t align our car\u2019s front end \u2013 tires wear  NO matter what kind of tires we put<br />\n            on our car<br />\n\u2022\tIf we put gasoline in a diesel car or diesel in a gasoline car \u2013 They won\u2019t run<br />\n\u2022\tNo oil/grease in car \u2013 what happens ?<br />\n\u2022\tWE must take special care of the miraculous \u201cUS\u201d<br />\n\u2022\tSo I decided, with my wife, to align my body properly &amp; stop placing foods &amp; liquids filled with dangerous chemicals into my body!<br />\nI went on a strict macrobiotic/organic Plant Based Diet similar to Dr, Caldwell Esselstyn, Jrs. diet. My success was in large part due to the considerable assistance/contributions of my wife, Verne Varona \u2013 world\u2019s top macrobiotic counselor &amp; author of several diet books including his latest \u2013 Macrobiotics for Dummies, Michio Kushi\u2019s books &amp; many others,  Therefore what I accomplished is not mine \u2013 It is gathered from MANY sources &amp; is for ALL to benefit from.   Given some experience in Due Diligence or looking into \u201cActual\u201d beneficial activities for our Immune systems, I absorbed the above-mentioned alternative experts books, presentations &amp; websites. It was necessary to undertake a LOT of time, energy &amp; commitment that turned out to be 4+ years with a \u201creal\u201d average of 5 hours a day on the internet, etc.  I was motivated from a negative diagnosis about my metastasized Prostate Cancer &amp; kept at it.<br />\nI also was aware that:<br />\n\u2022\tThere are known things we know that we know.<br />\n\u2022\tThere are things that we know that we don\u2019t know.<br />\n\u2022\tBut there are MANY things that we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know.<br />\n\u2022\tThere are things that we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know<br />\nWhat I now know, &amp; recognize, is that a growing awareness, of the ability of our immune systems to assist us in becoming a cancer, &amp; or illness, survivor, is increasing worldwide There are populations, Okinawans, Hunza\u2019s, Sardinians, Loma Linda, CA ( 7th Day Adventists),  that all  \u201clive healthy, long lives\u201d.  We have a massive dead zone in the Gulf \u2013 Grow animals for food or raise food on lane in order to be competitive CHEMICALS, etc.<br />\n\u2022\t MANY animals are fine with eating just \u201cgrass &amp; water\u201d \u2013 Cows-Horses, pigs, chickens, geese, swans, ducks, &amp; most other birds.<br />\n\u2022\t\u201cIf you ate 1 cup of spinach in 1954, the amount of iron you would receive is comparable to eating 60 cups of spinach today.  I think it\u2019s a powerful representation of what is happening to our food chain<br />\n\u2022\tUnited Nations, World Health Org, &amp; MANY others \u2013Advises STOPPING public exposure to -Way to many DANGEROUS TOXIC Chemicals !<br />\n\u2022\t3-2011 FDA confirmed that 80% of all antibiotics used in the U.S. go to animal agriculture. Today&#8217;s Food System: All Drugged Up  next time you&#8217;re feeling sick, think twice before going to your MD for answers. Look down at your plate, instead.  Hidden in your hamburger or smoked ham may be something you didn&#8217;t want or expect on the menu &#8212; antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Instead of protecting you from infectious diseases, antibiotics might simply be making you sick.<br />\n\u2022\tStaggering, almost uncountable, number of Chemicals, Drugs, Pesticides, Fertilizers, Hormones, Food Additives-coloring-taste enhancers preservatives, into the MANY thousands.<br />\n\u2022\tExamine the WHY- of strokes, bad arteries, cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, joint problems with new knees &amp; hips.  NUTRITION with TOO MANY CHEMICALS seems to be the constant culprit.<br />\nTherefore I embarked on a mission of wellness enhancement; engaged  in/on a strict Kushi Macrobiotic-Organic diet  &amp; in 8+ weeks dropped from 154 pounds,(@ 5\u20199\u201d), to 132 , a 22 pound loss. Bill Clinton has had similar (results with a heart-driven Plant Based Diet). I also discovered that it takes about 4 months to fully change our blood.  I therefore remained on Verne Varona\u2019s/ Kushi\u2019s modified organic/macrobiotic diet.  As my investigations (due diligence) indicated that my immune system was restored to a positive state, I kept searching for additional enhancement methods, Protocols, Herbs, Nutrients, etc. I finally found the Baking Soda and/ or Cesium chloride experts that had experienced success in beating cancers. A good one was Vern (Vito) Johnston &amp; his \u201ccommon sense\u201d Protocol &amp; his internet site, <a href=\"http://www.phkillscancer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.phkillscancer.com</a>.  My result was almost identical to Vern\u2019s.  I now am able to eat some \u201cregular\u201d meals &amp; dinners from a menu @ a normal American restaurant.   I still concentrate on organic foods, brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, and whole oats at breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30+ minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, apricot seeds, chia seeds, goji berries, some herbs, a few special vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda.<br />\nAll of my efforts diet wise, breathing, water, green teas, etc. are to maintain a slight alkalinity.<br />\n\u2022\tThose that say Vern\u2019s, Kushi\u2019s,diet etc. &amp; my protocol/methods can cure almost anyone who has not damaged themselves by Drugs-Alcohol-Smoking, etc. \u2013 except brain cancer \u2013 may be on the right track. They offer books, web sites, chat rooms, blogs, etc. that all indicate that this Diet Protocol is available, fairly inexpensive &amp; IMPORTANTLY raises our pH to over 7.5+ resulting in Cancer Cell demise. There is considerable material easily available about Cesium Chloride &amp; Baking Soda raising pH for decades.  The MANY uses of Baking Soda are strong indicators of this well established pH reality.<br />\nI Found the following statement: When people learn to eat a plant based diet they can eliminate heart disease &amp; cancer it could inaugurate a seismic revolution in our health. Other diseases that can be resolved with a plant based diet include: obesity, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, gall stones, diverticulitis, asthma, osteoporosis, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and a marked decrease in the common western cancers of breast, prostate, colon, endometrial, ovarian, and pancreatic&#8212;&#8212;So says Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., who was a researcher &amp; clinician at the Cleveland Clinic for over 35 years. He wrote a Great book \u2013 \u201cPrevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease\u201d.<br />\n\u2022\tWe all are the same \u2013 except for some inherited Genes, various opinions, points-of-view-beliefs-attitudes-positions-habits-tendencies, derived from our past &amp; the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d we are subjected to by sophisticated marketing entities seeking revenues/profits throughout our lives.<br />\n\u2022\t Nutrition &amp; diet have not been heavily taught in our educational backgrounds.<br />\n\u2022\t Today is the 1st day of the rest of our lives SO \u2013 decide to CHANGE   Therefore, I STRONGLY urge all interested folks to appreciate their body\u2019s capabilities &amp; undertake whatever changes are required to enhance your immune systems !<br />\n\u2022\tAll we have is \u201cour time &amp; our energy\u201d, as long as it lasts.<br />\n So eat organic \u2013 Brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, whole oats-breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30 minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, apricot seeds, chia seeds, goji berries, some herbs, a few vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda.  Acquire new habits that empower your Immune System so as to enhance your quality of life !   Be good to your body &amp; it will be good to you !</p>\n<p>NOTE: I am not a doctor.

This is NOT a medical cure (the closest thing to it) as you can reacquire symptoms if you don&#8217;t seriously monitor your diet on a continueing basis.  This is not a magic bullet (there aren&#8217;t any) because YOU are going to have to do all the work but the better quality of life would seem morethan worth it to me.

I beat it &amp; have had many people contact me requesting data on how I did it. Well, here it is, &amp; to keep it simple, I utilized my underappreciated, in this society, Immune System that, basically, is the same as everyone else\u2019s.<br />\n                         Therefore, what I accomplished &#8211; so can YOU !<br />\nAfter the rather significant overdose of medical negativeness I concentrated on what is possible, having studied Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, David Williams, Tony Robbins, Marianne Williamson, Andrew Weil, M.D., Dr. Julian Whitaker, Verne Varona, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr., Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. T. Colin Campbell (China Study), Ruan Jin Zhao, Ph.D., O.M.D, L.A.c. &amp; re-read my version of a bible, \u201cConfession of a Kamikaze Cowboy\u201d by Dirk Benedict.  Dirk earned a bit of notoriety/fame from his participation in the A-Team, Battlestar Gallactica, Charlie\u2019s Angels, etc. Also Living Well Naturally by Dr. Anthony J. Sattilaro, etc. I determined that we all enjoy a body that is a miraculous machine that must be aligned properly with a quality diet, exercise, quality liquids, deep breathing, organic foods, &amp; minimum stress, in a FAST paced society, along with some occasional \u201cTLC\u201d.<br />\n\u2022\tIf we don\u2019t align our car\u2019s front end \u2013 tires wear regardless of the type of tires we buy/use.<br />\n\u2022\tIf we put gasoline in a diesel car or diesel in a gasoline car \u2013 They won\u2019t run<br />\n\u2022\tNo oil/grease in car \u2013 what happens ?<br />\n\u2022\tWE must take special care of the miraculous \u201cUS\u201d<br />\n\u2022\tSo I decided, with my wife, to align my body properly &amp; stop placing foods &amp; liquids filled with dangerous chemicals into my body, by going ORGANIC !<br />\nI went on a strict macrobiotic/organic Plant Based Diet similar to Dr, Caldwell Esselstyn, Jrs. diet, with NO SUGAR. My success was in large part due to the considerable assistance/contributions of my wife, Verne Varona \u2013 world\u2019s top macrobiotic counselor &amp; author of several diet books including his latest \u2013 Macrobiotics for Dummies, Michio Kushi\u2019s books &amp; many others,  Therefore what I accomplished is not mine \u2013 It is gathered from MANY sources &amp; is for ALL to benefit from.  Given some experience in Due Diligence or looking into \u201cActual\u201d beneficial activities for our Immune systems, I absorbed the above-mentioned alternative experts books, presentations &amp; websites. It was necessary to undertake a LOT of time, energy &amp; commitment that turned out to be 4+ years with a \u201creal\u201d average of 5 hours a day on the internet, etc.  I was motivated from a negative diagnosis about my metastasized Prostate Cancer &amp; kept at it.<br />\nI also was aware that:<br />\n\u2022\tThere are known things that we know .<br />\n\u2022\tThere are things that we know that we don\u2019t know.<br />\n\u2022\tPROBLEM -There are things that we don\u2019t \u201cEVEN\u201d  know that we don\u2019t know<br />\nThere are populations such as Okinawans,  Hunza\u2019s, Sardinians, Loma Linda, CA ( 7th Day Adventists), that all \u201clive healthy, long lives\u201d.  We have a massive dead zone in the Gulf \u2013 Grow animals for food or raise food &amp; in order to be competitive must use CHEMICALS, etc.<br />\n\u2022\t MANY animals are fine with eating just \u201cgrass &amp; water\u201d \u2013 Cows-Horses, pigs, chickens, geese, swans, ducks, &amp; most other birds.Plant Based Organic Diet is a GREAT healer.<br />\n\u2022\t\u201cIf you ate 1 cup of spinach in 1954, the amount of iron you would receive is comparable to eating 60 cups of spinach today.  I think it\u2019s a powerful representation of what has, &amp; is, happening to our food chain<br />\n\u2022\tUnited Nations, World Health Org, &amp; MANY others \u2013Advise STOPPING public exposure to \u2013<br />\n                \u201cSO\u201d many DANGEROUS TOXIC Chemicals !<br />\n\u2022\t3-2011 FDA confirmed that 80% of all antibiotics used in the U.S. go to animal agriculture. Today&#8217;s Food System: Excessive Chemicals,  next time you&#8217;re feeling sick, think twice before going to your MD for answers. Look down at your plate, instead.  Hidden in your hamburger or smoked ham may be something you didn&#8217;t want or expect  &#8212; antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Instead of protecting you from infectious diseases, antibiotics might simply be making you sick.<br />\n\u2022\tStaggering, almost uncountable, number of Chemicals, Drugs, Pesticides, Fertilizers, Hormones, Food Additives-coloring-addictive taste enhancers preservatives, blended into the food supply -OURS!<br />\n\u2022\tExamine the WHY- of strokes, bad arteries, cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, joint problems with new knees &amp; hips.  Food with TOO MANY CHEMICALS seems to be the constant culprit.<br />\nTherefore I embarked on a mission of wellness enhancement; engaged  in/on a strict Kushi Macrobiotic-Organic diet  &amp; in 8+ weeks dropped from 154 pounds, to 132,= 22 pound loss. Bill Clinton has had similar (results with a heart-driven Dr. Esselstyn Plant Based Diet). I also discovered that it takes about 4 months to fully change our blood.  I therefore remained on Verne Varona\u2019s/ Kushi\u2019s modified organic/macrobiotic diet.  As my investigations (due diligence) indicated that my immune system was restored to a positive state, I kept searching for additional enhancement methods, Protocols, Herbs, Nutrients, etc. I finally found the Baking Soda and/ or Cesium chloride experts that had experienced success in beating cancers. A good one was Vern (Vito) Johnston &amp; his \u201ccommon sense\u201d Protocol &amp; his internet site, <a href=\"http://www.phkillscancer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.phkillscancer.com</a>.  My result was almost identical to Vern\u2019s.  I now am able to eat some \u201cregular\u201d meals &amp; dinners from a menu @ a normal (profit driven) restaurant.   I still concentrate on organic foods, brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, &amp; whole oats at breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30+ minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, apricot seeds, chia seeds, aloe, some herbs, a few special vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda.<br />\nAll of my efforts diet wise, breathing, water, green teas, etc. are to maintain a slight alkalinity.<br />\n\u2022\tThose that say Vern\u2019s, Kushi\u2019s, diet, etc. &amp; my protocol/methods can cure almost anyone who has not damaged themselves by Drugs-Alcohol-Smoking, etc. \u2013 except brain cancer \u2013 may be on the right track. They offer books, web sites, chat rooms, blogs, etc. that all indicate that this Diet Protocol is available, fairly inexpensive &amp; IMPORTANTLY raises our pH to over 7.8+ resulting in Cancer Cell demise. There is considerable material easily available about Cesium Chloride &amp; Baking Soda raising pH for decades.  The MANY uses of Baking Soda are strong indicators of this well established pH reality.</p>\n<p>I Found the following statement: \u201cWhen people learn to eat a plant based diet they can eliminate heart disease &amp; cancer it could inaugurate a seismic revolution in our health. Other diseases that can be 80% resolved with a plant based diet include: obesity, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, gall stones, diverticulitis, asthma, osteoporosis, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and a marked decrease in the common western cancers of breast, prostate, colon, endometrial, ovarian, &amp; pancreatic\u201d. So says Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., who was a researcher &amp; clinician at the Cleveland Clinic for 35+ years &amp; wrote a book \u2013 \u201cPrevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u2022\tWe all are the same \u2013 except for some inherited Genes, various opinions, points-of-view-beliefs-attitudes-positions-habits-tendencies, derived from our past &amp; the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d we are subjected to by sophisticated marketing entities seeking revenues/profits throughout our lives.<br />\n\u2022\t Nutrition &amp; diet have not been taught in our educational backgrounds.<br />\n\u2022\t Today is the 1st day of the rest of our lives SO \u2013 decide to CHANGE   Therefore, I STRONGLY urge all interested folks to appreciate their body\u2019s capabilities &amp; undertake whatever changes are required to enhance/strengthen your immune systems !<br />\n\u2022\tAll we have is \u201cour time &amp; our energy\u201d, as long as it lasts.  So eat organic \u2013 Brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, whole oats-breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30 minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, chia seeds, Aloe, some herbs, special vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda.  Acquire new habits that empower your Immune System so as to enhance your quality of life !   Be good to your body &amp; it will be good to you !</p>\n<p>NOTE: I am not a doctor.

To change your blood &#8211; Do ORGANIC Plant Based Diet \u2013 NO CHEMICALS  &#8211;<br />\nHere is my Protocol &#8211; Avoid any forms of sugar-Organic food- for 1 month+ then Initiate as follows:<br />\n\u2022\t1st day- 1 Teaspoon of BS soda with &amp; 1 cup room temp water 2x day (away from meals), 2 Teaspoons of Black Strap molasses (\u201cBSM\u201d) Heat @ \u201cLOW\u201d temp in pan for 5 min. &amp; STIR a lot to fully combine your sugar &amp; BSM into \u201cYOUR Trojan Horse\u201d to benefit your body -immune system. The molasses/maple syrup targets cancer cells (which consume 15X more glucose than normal cells) &amp; the baking soda, (which is dragged into the cancer cell by the maple syrup/BSM), being very alkaline, forces a rapid shift in pH thereby killing the cancer cells quickly in hrs).<br />\n\u2022\t2nd day \u2013 repeat, also Do Deep breathing (30x &#8211; 3-10x day or more).  OXYGEN KILLS cancer cells<br />\n\u2022\t3rd day \u2013 same  Cancer cells gobble up sugar so when you use sugar it\u2019s like sending in \u201cyour own Trojan horse\u201d. The sugar is \u201cnot\u201d going to encourage the growth of the cancer colonies as the alkaline baking soda (14pH) is going to kill the cells before they have a chance to grow.<br />\n\u2022\t4th day \u2013 same  2X day goal get to 8.0 &#8211; 8.5 pH &amp; hold 4-5 days &amp;  cancer cells dormant<br />\n\u2022\tat pH 7.5+ &amp; kills cancer cells @ 7.8-8.5.  My pH was 8.53 on 3rd day with a blood &amp; urine test.<br />\n\u2022\t5th day &#8211; started taking the solution &#8211; 2 tspns BS &amp; 2 Tsps BSM 2X day<br />\n\u2022\t6th day\u2013 repeat 2 Tspns BS &amp; 2 Tspn of BSM &amp; 1 cup of water 2x a day. My pH measured 8.25. That is what happens with cesium chloride/BS done by Italian Dr. Simoncini, mild nausea is good as it means the dead cancer cells are being discarded by your body.<br />\n\u2022\t7th \u2013 All ok &#8211; lips tingled- an Oxygen Euphoria from a lot deep breathing. Oxygen assists in killing bone/ALL cancer! Also on day 7, increased BS to 3 Tspns. &amp; got a slight headache, backed off to 2 Tspns BS- I was a bit uncomfortable/nervous &amp; had a slight headache, so I reduced it. I had slight confusion.  Do 30+ DEEP breaths several times per day \u2013 VERY IMPORTANT !<br />\n\u2022\t8th day \u2013 double dose 3x a day to get pH high- could some be health issues with too much BS   Potassium (200+mg intake is IMPORTANT.  FILTERED water !!  Exercise also.<br />\n\u2022\t9th day \u2013 A little diarrhea, a little weak feeling, really began to up my potassium intake.  All experts said that high dosage of potassium (also with cesium chloride) is very important. Oxygenation euphoria all day from deep breathing.  Ok     KILLING cancer cells more important !<br />\n\u2022\t10th day &#8211;  Headache more persistent, body sweats SO- I cut back to a solution 2x a day; not 3x.<br />\n\u2022\t11th day \u2013 down to 1.5 Tspns to control headache, bit of loose stools, slight headache &amp; night sweats. I cut back felt overloaded- 8.35 goal achieved &amp; I wanted to maintain pH 8.0+ for 4-5 days.<br />\n\u2022\tNOTE: Key Points: Take BS solution 2 hrs before or 2 hrs after eating, to give stomach acids time to digest food. Eat HIGH potassium organic foods, SUPPLEMENTS, vitamins, minerals, &amp; herbs as recommended for Cesium/Baking Soda Therapy by others with noted successes.<br />\n\u2022\tWatch blood pressure- take Potassium.

Caldwell Esselstyn &amp; Dean Ornish &#8211; What the Interview Didn&#8217;t Have Time to Explain about How to Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease with a Plant-Based Heart Diet</p>\n<p>President Bill Clinton is on a Plant-based Diet from Dr. Esselstyn &amp; Dr. Ornish<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2010/09/24/tsr.blitzer.clinton.doctors.cnn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2010/09/24/tsr.blitzer.clinton.doctors.cnn</a><br />\nRecently we had the pleasure of watching Drs. Esselstyn &amp; Ornish explain on national TV just how a Plant-based diet can prevent or reverse heart disease.  Only, 9 minutes can&#8217;t do it justice.  So here&#8217;s the rest of the story.    As we watched, we reviewed  Bill Clinton\u2019s past heart  issues, &amp; noted the Diet\u2019s similarity to an organic Plant Based  Cancer Diet..<br />\nSept. 2004: Bill Clinton has quadruple bypass surgery to repair blocked arteries after experiencing chest pain.<br />\nFeb. 10, 2010:  Clinton has 2 stents placed in one of his previously-treated arteries, after one of his bypass grafts completely closed up.  According to his MD, Clinton had &#8220;toed the line&#8221; adhering to diet, exercise &amp; medical therapy<br />\nSpring, 2010:  The stents fail to prevent further cardiovascular blockages. This is not an unusual occurrence. Clinton decides to read the medical literature about preventing and reversing heart disease.  He discovers that there is only one  way to do this&#8211;a strict Plant-based Diet loaded with green leafy vegetables, and without meat, chicken, fish, dairy, or added oils.  The two physician&#8217;s who are pioneers in this treatment approach are Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn and Dr. Dean Ornish.-  Clinton decided to conduct his own personal clinical trial.<br />\nDr.E sselstyn- Zero cardiovascular events have occurred in Dr. Esselstyn&#8217;s original group of 17 compliant patients that he has followed for over the past 25 years.  Esselstyn continues to work with hundreds of other patients who have similar success stories.  There is no mortality, no morbidity, no expense from following a plant-based diet&#8211;if you eat in a way that makes the cap over your plaque super strong!  Like most Americans, Wolf Blitzer didn&#8217;t seem to understand why bypass surgery or stents cannot cure cardiovascular disease. These procedures only treat emergency blockages.  And statins are no guarantee that it won&#8217;t happen again.  Too bad Dr. Esselstyn didn&#8217;t have a chance to tell Blitzer this:  &#8220;Some people think the &#8220;diet&#8221; is extreme.  Half a million people a year will have their chests opened up and a vein taken from their leg and sewn onto their coronary artery.  Some people would call that extreme.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;The elephant in the room when we talk about stents &amp; bypass surgery&#8211;those procedures don&#8217;t protect from new heart attacks.   Stents &amp; bypasses are used to treat large arterial blockages.  The CAUSE is IGNORED  &#8211; DIET. According to many research studies only a small percentage of heart attacks are caused by the largest build-up of plaque.  The rest are caused by the more numerous newer blockages that are far more inflamed and much more likely to rupture than the larger older, more stable plaques.  So this is why those procedures don&#8217;t treat the disease.  They are treating the symptoms NOT the Cause.  </p>\n<p>STOP chemicals from entering your body, OVERWHELMING IMMUNE SYSTEMS &amp; permitting many diseases !</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a Dr. &amp; I have not had any medical training.

(Chemo kills cells Indiscriminately)<br />\nConsider the following:<br />\n\u2022\tThere are known things that we know .<br />\n\u2022\tThere are things that we know that we don\u2019t know.<br />\n\u2022\tPROBLEM -There are things that we don\u2019t \u201cEVEN\u201d  know that we don\u2019t know</p>\n<p>Must utilize our underappreciated, Immune System that, basically, is the same as everyone else\u2019s &#8211; Therefore, what I accomplished &#8211; so can ANYONE !<br />\nI determined that we all enjoy a body that is a miraculous machine that must be &#8220;aligned properly&#8221; with a quality diet, exercise, quality liquids, deep breathing, organic foods, &amp; minimum stress, in a FAST paced society, along with some occasional \u201cTLC\u201d.<br />\n\u2022\tIf we don\u2019t align car\u2019s front end \u2013 tires wear until we correct the CAUSE of tire wear.

Given some experience in Due Diligence Investigations or looking into \u201cActual\u201d reality (rather than aggressive marketing, spinning, exaggerating, etc). I found REAL beneficial whole food products.  I also found populations Okinawans,  Hunza\u2019s, Sardinians, Loma Linda, CA ( 7th Day Adventists), that all \u201clive healthy, long lives\u201d).  USA is ranked as the sickest country world, yet spends more for so called healthcare than many other countries combined, has a massive dead zone in the Gulf, ranked # 47 in life expectancy &amp; are allowing the medical system to sicken-maim &amp; kill hundreds of millions including our children. Money rules Wash. D.C. incl. the FDA.<br />\n\u2022\tIF anyone chooses to Grow animals in competitive time frames for food or raise food (yield per acre) &amp; in order to be competitive must use CHEMICALS, etc.<br />\nMANY animals are fine with eating just \u201cgrass &amp; water\u201d \u2013 Cows-Horses, pigs, chickens, geese, swans, ducks, &amp; most other birds. Plant Based Organic Diet is a GREAT healer.<br />\nStaggering, almost uncountable, number of Chemicals, Drugs, Pesticides, Fertilizers, Hormones, Food Additives-coloring-addictive taste enhancers preservatives, blended into the food supply -OURS!  Drugs have killed MILLIONS !<br />\n2.     Examine the WHY/CAUSE- of strokes, bad arteries, cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, diabetes,  joint problems with new knees &amp; hips.  Food with TOO MANY CHEMICALS seems to be the constant cause &amp; culprit, overworking our immune systems. Therefore I embarked on a mission of wellness enhancement; engaged  in/on a strict Kushi Macrobiotic-Organic diet  &amp; in 8+ weeks dropped from 154 pounds, to 132,= 22 pound loss.<br />\n1.\tBill Clinton has had similar (results with a heart-driven Dr. Esselstyn Plant Based Diet). I also discovered that it takes about 4 months to fully change our blood.  I therefore remained on Verne Varona\u2019s/ Kushi\u2019s modified organic/macrobiotic diet- immune system was restored to a positive state, I kept searching for additional enhancement methods, Protocols, Herbs, Nutrients, etc. I finally found the Baking Soda (&amp;/ or Cesium chloride) experts that had experienced success in beating cancers. A good one was Vern (Vito) Johnston &amp; his \u201ccommon sense\u201d Protocol &amp; his internet site. <a href=\"http://phkillscancer.com/vernons_dance_with_cancer\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://phkillscancer.com/vernons_dance_with_cancer</a>.<br />\n2.\t  I now am able to eat some \u201cregular\u201d meals &amp; dinners from a menu @ a normal restaurant. I still concentrate on organic foods, brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, &amp; whole oats at breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30+ minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, apricot seeds, chia seeds, Herbal Aloe Force, some herbs, a few special vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda.<br />\nAll of my efforts diet wise, breathing, water, green teas, etc. are to maintain a slight alkalinity.<br />\n\u2022\tThose that say Vern Varons&#8217;a, Kushi\u2019s, diet, etc. &amp; my protocol/methods can cure almost anyone who has not damaged themselves by Drugs-Alcohol-Smoking, etc. \u2013 are on the right track. They offer books, web sites, chat rooms, blogs, etc. that all indicate that this Diet Protocol is available, fairly inexpensive &amp; IMPORTANTLY raises our pH to over 7.6+ mine 8.5 on 3rd day resulting in Cancer Cell demise. There is considerable material easily available about Baking Soda raising pH for decades.  The MANY uses of Baking Soda are strong indicators of this well established pH reality.<br />\n3. Discovered another Book about heart problems by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., who was a researcher &amp; clinician at the Cleveland Clinic for 35+ years &amp; wrote a very important book \u2013 \u201cPrevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease\u201d.  Bill Clinton went on Dr. Esselstyn&#8217;s  Plant Based Diet that is similar to my Plant Based Diet.  Cancer Diet allows NO SUGAR Heart  Diet allows sugar. Bill went on CNN with Wolf Blitzer as a fill in &amp; was a BIG hit. Then went on CNN with Dr. Sanja Gupta, The Last Heart Attack. </p>\n<p>I strongly &#8220;ENDORSE&#8221; the following statement: \u201cWhen people learn to eat a plant based diet they can eliminate heart disease &amp; cancer it could inaugurate a seismic revolution in our health. Other diseases that can be 80% resolved with a plant based diet include: obesity, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, gall stones, diverticulitis, asthma, osteoporosis, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, &amp; a marked decrease in the common western cancers of breast, prostate, colon, endometrial, ovarian, &amp; pancreatic\u201d. So says Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., who was a researcher &amp; clinician at the Cleveland Clinic for 35+ years &amp; wrote a very important book \u2013 \u201cPrevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease\u201d. 23  patients that Cleveland Clinic gave up on to die, after Stents open heart, etc. Dr, Esselstyn put them (only 17) on his diet. All lived over a decade &amp; many longer.<br />\n We all are basically the same \u2013 except for some inherited Genes, various opinions, points-of-view-beliefs-attitudes-positions-habits-tendencies, derived from our past &amp; the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d we are subjected to by sophisticated marketing entities seeking revenues/profits throughout our lives.<br />\n\u2022\t Nutrition &amp; diet have not been taught in our educational backgrounds.<br />\n\u2022\t Today is the 1st day of the rest of our lives SO \u2013 decide to CHANGE   Therefore, I STRONGLY urge all interested folks to appreciate their body\u2019s capabilities &amp; undertake whatever DIET changes are required to enhance/strengthen your immune systems !<br />\n\u2022\tAll we have is \u201cour time &amp; our energy\u201d, as long as it lasts.  So eat organic \u2013 Brown rice, beans, various  green veggies, whole oats-breakfast, filtered water, deep breathing, walking 30 minutes a day, 8 hours of sleep, fruits, chia seeds, ALOE, some herbs, special vitamins, &amp; occasional Baking Soda<br />\nWhat&#8217;s the Difference between God &amp; a Dr. &#8211; God doesn&#8217;t think he is a Dr. &#8211; A Dr.  thinks he is GOD<br />\n\u2022\tUnderstand it&#8217;s Us against a dangerous Profit driven system You all want to enjoy a healthy life or wouldn&#8217;t be reading this material about beating Cancer &amp; Heart disease.<br />\n\u2022\tUSA Healthcare system &#8211; is revenue driven &#8211;  sickens maims kills hundreds millions<br />\n\u2022\tDo you want to be Steve Jobs or me ?

My husband was diagnosed in july  &#8217;10 with bladder cancer.  They removed his bladder in feb. of &#8217;11.  Since we have been dealing with cancer that has spread.  He had a &#8216;clean&#8217; pet scan in dec. of &#8217;11.  In feb. of this year, they found that the cancer was back and had spread to several other places including the brain.  He began radiation for the brain and chemo for the &#8216;body&#8217; stuff.  Just today I was given the results of a bone scan which said that it has now spread to all of his bones.  &#8220;Too numerous to count&#8221; was how it was reported to me.  Let me say this before I get into my questions&#8230;my husband has always been a firm believer in natural healing and has for most of his life used natural remedies.  We attempted to treat the cancer naturally, but at the time we felt it was too advanced to get ahead of it, so we chose to do chemo.  He responded really well to chemo and did not have most of the horrible side effects and we attribute this to the natural remedies he was still taking.<br />\nSo he has had chemo in the past month and is do for another treatment next tuesday, as well as radiation which he had in march.  He is taking several pharmaceutical meds, to help with pain, and other stuff.<br />\nMy questions are these:<br />\n1.   does he have to be off sugar for a month before starting this?<br />\n2.    are his meds and chemo and radiation going to change the effects of doing this?<br />\n3.  does this have to be heated up to be fully effective&#8230;I was told just to mix it up and eat it..(we are using the black strap molasses)</p>\n<p>Thanks for any info you could give me!!<br />\nRagan</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=5207#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-5207\", \"5207\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Ragan Maxwell'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-5208\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bf6da8c823ee765b4ed098c15081f4e7?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Ragan Maxwell</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-5208\">\n\t2012/04/20 at 6:20 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>We are also about to put him on a &#8220;juicing&#8221; only diet.

To change your blood &#8211; Do ORGANIC Plant Based Diet \u2013 NO CHEMICALS<br />\nAVOID Any forms of SUGAR-Eat Organic food- for 1 month, then Initiate as follows:<br />\n\u2022\t1st day- 1 Teaspoon of BS soda with &amp; 1 cup room temp water 2x day (away from meals), 2 Teaspoons of Black Strap molasses (\u201cBSM\u201d) Heat @ \u201cLOW\u201d temp in pan for 5 min. &amp; STIR a lot to fully combine your sugar &amp; BSM into \u201cYOUR own Trojan Horse\u201d to benefit your body -immune system. The molasses/maple syrup targets cancer cells (which consume 15X more glucose than normal cells) &amp; the baking soda, (which is dragged into the cancer cell by the maple syrup/BSM), being very alkaline, forces a rapid shift in pH thereby killing the cancer cells quickly in hrs).<br />\n\u2022\t2nd day \u2013 repeat, also Do Deep breathing (30x &#8211; 3-10x day or more).  OXYGEN KILLS cancer cells<br />\n\u2022\t3rd day \u2013 same  Cancer cells gobble up sugar so when you use sugar it\u2019s like sending in \u201cyour own Trojan horse\u201d. The sugar is \u201cnot\u201d going to encourage the growth of the cancer colonies as the alkaline baking soda (14pH) is going to kill the cells before they have a chance to grow.<br />\n\u2022\t4th day \u2013 same  2X day goal get to 8.0 &#8211; 8.5 pH &amp; hold 4-5 days &amp;  cancer cells dormant<br />\n\u2022\tat pH 7.5+ &amp; kills cancer cells @ 7.8-8.5.

My pH measured 8.25. That is what happens with cesium chloride/BS done by Italian Dr. Simoncini, mild nausea is good as it means the dead cancer cells are being discarded by your body.<br />\n\u2022\t7th \u2013 All ok &#8211; lips tingled- an Oxygen Euphoria from a lot deep breathing. Oxygen assists in killing bone/ALL cancer! Also on day 7, increased BS to 3 Tspns. &amp; got a slight headache, backed off to 2 Tspns BS- I was a bit uncomfortable/nervous &amp; had a slight headache, so I reduced it. I had slight confusion.  Do 30+ DEEP breaths several times per day \u2013 VERY IMPORTANT !<br />\n\u2022\t8th day \u2013 double dose 3x a day to get pH high- could some be health issues with too much BS<br />\n      Potassium 200+mg intake is IMPORTANT. Filtered water also &amp;  Exercise/walk 30 min. daily.<br />\n\u2022\t9th day \u2013 A little diarrhea, a little weak feeling, really began to up my potassium intake.  All experts said that high dosage of potassium (also with cesium chloride) is very important. Oxygenation euphoria all day from deep breathing.  Ok     KILLING cancer cells more important !<br />\n\u2022\t10th day &#8211;  Headache more persistent, body sweats SO- I cut back to a solution 2x a day; not 3x.<br />\n\u2022\t11th day \u2013 down to 1.5 Tspns to control headache, bit of loose stools, slight headache &amp; night sweats. I cut back felt overloaded- 8.35 goal achieved &amp; I wanted to maintain pH 8.0+ for 4-5 days.<br />\n\u2022\tNOTE: Key Points: Take BS solution 2 hrs before or 2 hrs after eating, to give stomach acids time to digest food. Eat HIGH potassium organic foods, SUPPLEMENTS, vitamins, minerals, &amp; herbs as recommended for Cesium/Baking Soda Therapy by others with noted successes.<br />\n\u2022\tWatch blood pressure- take Potassium.

The other good thing is, her parents do not know of any other choices.The other, other good thing is, your niece is big enough to drink from a bottle or a sippy cup. Drink at room temperature, or slightly cool or slightly warm&#8230;whatever is preferred. If it were me, I would water down the recipe. I would also start with a bit extra black strap, Un-sulphered molasses or real maple syrup. Do taste tests. and always drink it as a family deal&#8230;EVERYBODY gets a special drink! </p>\n<p>Do remember to supplement with the nutrients listed in the protocol..especially the potassium which is found in bananas, ground sunflower seeds, and fresh apricots.  While on this regimen&#8230;at and serve potassium-rich foods everyday! I would not continue to increase the baking soda ratio unless she likes the drink. She is little, and should respond well, even if extra molasses is needed&#8230;.just be sure to nix everything together very well!</p>\n<p>What her parents will want to do is take a good honest look at what they and she have been eating and drinking. Any changes they make, they will want to make together. What one eats, they others eat. What one drinks, the others drink. All for one and one for all. Everybody gets new and better foods and we all eat TOGETHER! If you blend the foods, they will be easier for her to digest. So, if you are having brown rice and cooked carrots, blend the brown rice. Then blend the carrots&#8230;enough for EVERYONE! Have fun with this CELEBRATE with food! (Do not give her much raw food at first unless it is in the smoothie as mentioned below)</p>\n<p>Good clean healthy foods such as good, clean, not-chemically treated water, vegetables and whole grains such as brown rice and whole grain sprouted breads (which are surprisingly soft)! Fruits are OK, but veggies are better right now. If foods need to be sweetened to get her to eat or drink them, then Stevia (a naturally sweet plant extract) should be added. (Do NOT consume  any sugar, honey, syrup or chemical sweeteners). Stay away from packaged foods, meats and any sweet drinks other than the baking soda and molasses or maple syrup protocol. Adjust these ideas considering foods you have available where you live.</p>\n<p>Smoothies would be fantastic. Here is a good recipe. You would want to mix it well so that it is not gritty:<br />\nThis recipe makes about 8 cups smoothie&#8230;enough to serve 2-4 people. Place in blender in this order:</p>\n<p>3 cups pure water<br />\n3 cups raw spinach<br />\n2 other leaves such as collards or kale (mix and ,match is fine)<br />\n1/2 cup cooked and cooled brown rice<br />\n1 tsp (teaspoon) flax meal (sprouted is best) or flax seed (sprouted is best)<br />\nMix above ingredients until half-way smooth<br />\nNow add&#8230;.<br />\n2 apples (seeds and cores removed)<br />\n1 banana, peeled<br />\n1-2 cups berries such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries (frozen is best) (the less, the better)<br />\n1 packet of Stevia or 25 Stevia leaves from your garden<br />\nMix all this together until smooth. Taste. Add more Stevia as needed.<br />\nAdjustments to ingredients may be made.</p>\n<p>Your niece should never eat alone. Always with those she loves and enjoys and only after having fun doing the cheer I have written for you (Below)&#8230;or some cheers like it.</p>\n<p>Before drinking your smoothies, or eating any foods&#8230;shout this cheer all together and out loud&#8230;&#8230;get going with this&#8230;have fun, jump up and down, make a tune to fit the words, then make a cheer routine to fit the words too! This will seep right into her little soul (and her family&#8217;s too. Our Heavenly Father&#8217;s Health is only a thought away for the work has already been accomplished in Christ.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jesus! Jesus! You are so great!&#8221; (Arms in the air like a real cheer leader)!<br />\n&#8220;You bless my body and the food on my plate!&#8221; (Gently touch your abdomens just under the rib cage area&#8230;liver area:- and then out toward the food or drink)<br />\n&#8220;I am so happy I can run and play!&#8221; (Make little running motions even if she cannot get up yet).<br />\n&#8220;Jesus! Jesus, has healed me today!&#8221;  (Cup your hands around your mouths because you are shouting this from the rooftop)!<br />\n&#8220;Hooray&#8221;!

Additionally, I&#8217;ve been following the strict dietary regimen since late June when I was diagnosed with prostrate cancer and since completing the Trojan Horse have been monitoring my pH levels to keep them at 7.25 &#8211; 7.5 with diet and baking soda.  As an uninteneded consequence, I&#8217;ve also dropped from 248 lbs down to 218 lbs and continuing to drop.  I&#8217;m scheduled to have a blood test this Friday.  From what I&#8217;ve read, my PSA should be rather low in the 0.1 range. </p>\n<p>What does this really mean with respect to telling me how much my body is fighting the cancer?  My pH was low to begin with (2.77 in March 2012). It was because I noticed an unexpected jump in PSA during a short period of time last year that I agreed to have a biopsy which came back positive.</p>\n<p>If the Trojan Horse protocol is truly effective, then beyond just a 0.1 PSA, I would assume another biopsy would now be negative (althouhg I don&#8217;t relish doing that procedure again!).  Are there any other non-invasive procedures (other than bone SCAN and CT SCAN which only determines the degree to which, if at all, the stuff in your prostate has metastisized to other areas of your body) that indicate whether or not your prostate itself is clean?</p>\n<p>Also, are there any medical doctors who know of this protocol used in conjunction with a plant based diet that would be willing to consult with me?</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=6490#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-6490\", \"6490\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to JGC'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-6519\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6bf24f48b723690167322ff892baa689?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lolina</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-6519\">\n\t2012/07/18 at 11:28 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>What if pregnant?

I followed the instructions very closely, except I probably could have had more Green tea. Took all of the supplements with breathing. PSA last nine months has been +or- 1 point. That&#8217;s why I was shocked when it went up 2 1/2 points so quickly. I&#8217;m afraid to try the protocol again. Just very concerned as it has gone to the bone. I think about it nonstop.

You can see the way different people handle the news of cancer. Are you pleased with what you see in their results. If you are, then follow what they have done. </p>\n<p>Success follows success..whatever you do, do it running, if you look back, you will stumble. When that happens. pick yourself back up remember what you CAN see. My friend Don Porter is very much alive and well as is another friend of mine that had Prostate cancer and now the doctors say it is gone and he felt great all the way along. </p>\n<p>It can happen. It will  happen. It will probably happen to you too. On the other hand, you may die. If you like what you see in the people you know that have died, follow them. If not, find another way. All the best to you, my friend. You have your whole life ahead of you, just waiting for you to live it.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link'

yesterday&#8230;&#8230;..a  teaspoon morning and one at night..i felt pretty good this am &#8230;best i felt since  this thing flared  up. the doctor  is talking about excising it which might entail

I suggest strengthening Immune systems with a NO chemical diet  NO Fast or packaed foods, filter water, NO sugar, dairy, salt , sodas etc  The stronger Immune System can rebuild cells that have been eliminated with a high pH.</p>\n<p>Anyone &#8211; can beat nearly ALL forms of Cancer with an Organic Plant Based Diet &amp; a high pH</p>\n<p>Along with obesity, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, gall stones, diverticulitis, asthma, macular degeneration, acne, osteoporosis, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes 1&amp;2, multiple sclerosis, colds-flu, migraines, obesity, cognitive dysfunction, lupus, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, &amp; a initiate a marked decrease in the common western cancers of breast, prostate, colon, endometrial, ovarian, &amp; pancreatic.<br />\nDr. Caldwell B.

Please don&#8217;t repost your story, Don, in response to this question, as I would like to read about people (other than you) that have used the Trojan Horse method to cure their specific ailments/disease.  I have read this entire site and there are lots of people sharing how to make the Trojan Horse or what happens when it is not made properly, but my interest is more in what RESULTS people are having from using this method&#8211;other than posts about what Doctors say can happen when the pH of the body is alkaline.  Until there are testimonials, it is just a theory put into action, and even though your story is compelling, Don, there are cases where cancer goes into remission for no logical reason.  And please understand, I am not at all trying to argue against this remedy, as I used a rife machine and ozone machine to cure myself of candida, chronic fatigue, epstin barr virus many, many years ago when the medical profession diagnosed my severe symptoms as &#8220;all in my head.&#8221;  I am a big believer in the power of the immune system&#8211;and that cancer cannot live in oxygenated blood or alkaline environment. I&#8217;ve personally experienced the results&#8230;But  I&#8217;d just like to see the stories from others as far as their results using the Trojan Horse.

Many alkaline substances are highly toxic themselves.  For example, mineral hydroxides are extremely caustic and are some of the strongest radicals known. Neutralizing stomach acid with alkaline substances can lead to all sorts of health issues that occur from increased pathogenic infection, and decreased nutrient absorption that can lead to hypomethylation among other issues.  Look at what happens even if you hyperventilate. It will alkalize the blood instantly whether or not you are toxic, and as a result the blood vessels of the brain will constrict causing you to pass out.</p>\n<p>Problem is that most people have no clue the roles of acidity and alkalinity in the body.  For example, you mention toxins. Yet are you aware that the body&#8217;s main detoxifier is the liver? And what is the primary compound the liver uses to detoxify the body? Glucuronic acid. On the other hand the liver also produces alkaline bile that plays a role in detoxification.  Cellular energy requires a variety of acids, but alkaline sodium and potassium are also needed for proper cell function. The breakdown of amino acids forms highly alkaline and highly toxic ammonia. The body converts the toxic ammonia in to uric acid, one of the body&#8217;s primary anti-oxidants.</p>\n<p>Point is that the body is made up of and requires all sorts of acids for function.  But as with all of nature there is a balance.  Therefore, the body also requires a number of alkaline substances to balance the numerous beneficial acidic components of the body that allow us to exist and remain healthy.</p>\n<p>James</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 parent highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-7771\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f3097d388dd8e99bff5cdff7327f182a?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Serhio</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-7771\">\n\t2012/10/01 at 5:26 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Don, would you tell, please, what kind of pH meter you use to measure your figures&#8230;you numbers so precise&#8230;one couldn&#8217;t get it from the simple pH paper tape: on a tape it goes only till 8.0(deep purple color).

All diseases require an Acidic environment  to prosper. An Alkaline (or high pH) kills cancer cells. I utilized Dr. Otto Warburg&#8217;s work along with The Hidden Story of Cancer by Prof. Brian Scott Peskin, Dr. William Kelley, &amp; MANY other books, Blogs, Websites and articles (15,000 hours invested), to be able to create the success of eliminating my Stage IV Metasticized Prostate Cancer. I was given 3 yrs to live, Diagnosis, from a VA Dr., 5 1/2 yrs ago.  Following the above data, I suggest, that the Baking Soda Protocol will kill cancer cells after a pH of about 8.0 is achieved. An organic diet is recommended to strengthen the immune system prior to eliminating cancer cells in your body.</p>\n<p>I suggest reading: Recalled By Life by Dr. Anthony Satillaro, Kamikaze Cowboy, Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease by Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., The China Study, Cancer: Curing the Incurable by D. William Donald Kelley, etal, Ph Books &amp; several Hundred others related.  </p>\n<p>There is &#8220;What we know&#8221;.  There is &#8220;What we don&#8217;t know&#8221;. PROBLEM &#8211; There is &#8211; &#8220;What we don&#8217;t even know, that we don&#8217;t know&#8221;.    Throw in opinions, beliefs, points-of-view, attitudes, positions, desire to be right, egos, greed, self serving &amp; related &amp; you have quite a formula for frustration.</p>\n<p>A pH of 7.8 to mid 8&#8217;s, is known to be fatal to Cancer cells. I suggest doing as I did, first strengthening the Immune systems with a NO chemical laden foods-diet,  NO Fast or packaged foods,  NO sugar, dairy, salt , sodas, etc.  DO &#8211; Excercise, filter water, organic foods (preferably), lots of DEEP breathing (oxygen kills cancer cells). The restored &amp; stronger Immune System can then more effectively rebuild dead cancer cells, that have been eliminated with a high pH Alkaline diet and a Baking Soda (cesium chloride) high pH Protocol.</p>\n<p>An acid body is a magnet for sickness, disease, cancer and aging.  Eating more alkaline foods helps shift your body&#8217;s pH and oxygenates your system. Alkaline foods keep your body healthy and functioning correctly, preventing and combating cancer.  You become what you eat. &#8211; Food is the BEST Medicine </p>\n<p>pH Balance:<br />\nThe pH scale is from 0 to 14, with numbers below 7 acidic (low on oxygen) and numbers above 7 alkaline. The blood, lymph and cerebral spinal fluid in the human body are designed to be slightly alkaline at a pH of 7.4. At a pH slightly above 7.4 cancer cells become dormant and at pH 8.1+ cancer cells will die while healthy cells will live.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=9532#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-9532\", \"9532\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Don Porter'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-14300\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4f44a20c7fdd4dee663fa06159fd41fb?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">James</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-14300\">\n\t2014/01/08 at 6:06 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Warburg has to be the most misquoted person in history.</p>\n<p>Warburg NEVER claimed cancer was the result of acidity, nor that cancer was killed by alkalinity. In fact, studies have proven just the opposite.  The internal pH of cancer cells is more alkaline than healthy cells.  They maintain their excessive alkalinity to allow them to survive and thrive since an acidic internal pH kills cancer cells.  Therefore the cancer cells export acidic hydrogen ions (protons) in to the external matrix to maintain their alkalinity.  Studies have shown that when the hydrogen ion pumps are blocked preventing the export of the acidic hydrogen ions the internal pH of the cancer cells become acidic killing the cancer cell.  Studies have also proven that excess alkalinity of healthy cells causes the cells to revert to a cancerous state.</p>\n<p>Warburg NEVER claimed that cancer cells thrive in a low oxygen environment either. Warburg hypothesized that cancer cells had a respiratory defect and would continue to ferment REGARDLESS of how much oxygen was present.  This principle has become known as the &#8220;Warburg effect&#8221;.  Warburg&#8217;s hypothesis on the respiratory defect and how cancer cells were later disproven.</p>\n<p>Cancer cells, just like healthy cells, require both anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) for energy production.  The only difference is that healthy cells are more heavily reliant on OxPhos than cancer cells.  Still, cancer cells dertive 50% or more of their energy from OxPhos, which requires sufficient oxygen. In addition, the lower usage of OxPhos by cancer cells is compensated by cancer cells by the cancer cells having a much higher affinity for oxygen than healthy cells.</p>\n<p>If cancer cells are deprived of oxygen they die just like healthy cells.  This is actually the basis behind the vascular formation within malignant tumors.  When the tumor first starts forming its growth is severely limited by the lack of oxygen supply. The tumor can only grow to roughly 3mm in size before oxygen can no longer diffuse through the tumor. Since the cells in the middle of the tumor can no longer receive oxygen the center of the tumor dies from a lack of oxygen.  In response the tumor releases angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which allows the growth of blood vessels from the tumor and from a primary blood vessel. When this new vascular network connects the tumor now has a sufficient oxygen supply to allow its rapid growth.</p>\n<p>Another common myth surrounding Warburg is that Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering cancer was caused from a lack of oxygen or some people falsely claim by acidity.  None of these claims are true.  Warburg never claimed cancer resulted from a lack of oxygen, nor acidity. And Warburg won his Nobel Prize for the discovery of an enzyme he called &#8220;iron oxidase&#8221;.</p>\n<p>There are rumors that Warburg won a second Nobel Prize.  This is also a myth. Warburg was nominated for a second Nobel Prize, but was never awarded a second Nobel Prize.</p>\n<p>Another common myth is that all diseases result from acidity. Nothing can be further from the truth. First of all the body maintains a very tight control on its pH since both excessive acidity and especially excess alkalinity can be fatal.  Therefore, acidosis and alkalosis are both extremely rare conditions to begin with.  True acidosis is almost exclusively seen in poisoning and occurs in the very rare diabetic ketoacidosis.  Ironically, acidosis is also occasionally seen in hospital settings during IV bicarbonate therapy as the neutralization of acids by bicarbonate actually leads to the formation of carbonic acid.  Alkalosis, which is considered more dangerous than acidosis is most often seen during hyperventilation, liver failure or from the excess consumption of alkaline substances, such as milk-alkali syndrome.</p>\n<p>The only diseases I have ever seen directly related to acids is gout and pseudogout.  On the other hand peptic ulcers are often caused by the bacteria H. pylori, which thrives in an alkaline environment.  In order to protect itself from stomach acid H. pylori secretes highly alkaline and highly toxic ammonia to neutralize the stomach acid.  In fact, most pathogens are killed by acids and thrive in an alkaline environment.  This is one of the reasons maintaining stomach acid is so important. Stomach acid is a first line defense against ingested pathogens.  Our body flora also generate beneficial acids that among other things kill pathogens we are exposed to.  These acids also control Candida growth.  In an acidic environment the acids turn off the Candida growth gene and keep the Candida in its benign yeast form.  When the flora numbers are reduced, such as after antibiotic use, the pH of the terrain becomes overly alkaline.  This turns on the Candida growth gene and converts the Candida in to its pathogenic fungal form resulting in candidiasis.  In its fungal form the Candida forms finger-like projections called hyphae that allow the Candida to dig in to the tissues causing damage and inflammation such as seen in leaky gut syndrome.  And studies have shown that excess alkalinity of healthy cells causes the healthy cells to revert to a cancerous state. In addition, the highly alkaline internal pH of cancer cells allows them to survive and thrive.  The bacteria that cause urinary tract infections also cannot tolerate an acidic environment.  Therefore they secrete the enzyme urease to split urea forming highly alkaline ammonia to help them survive.  This is why urinary tract infections lead to a higher (alkaline) urinary pH.</p>\n<p>Other diseases have nothing to do with pH.  For example, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder resulting most often from viral infection or antibodies developed from giving infants cow&#8217;s milk. Type 2 diabetes results from a lack of chromium and/or magnesium resulting in closed insulin receptors.  Gestational diabetes results from a hormonal imbalance.  Colds, flu, most cancers, etc, result from viral infections that are normally killed by acids. The list goes on and on of diseases that have nothing to do with acidity or alkalinity.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=14300#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-14300\", \"14300\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to James'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-9536\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/200ad860be0af38d91481d932c0a261e?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Jake Sysk</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-9536\">\n\t2013/01/19 at 2:05 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Feeding my dog maple syrup and bicarbonate of soda for four weeks cured the red mange.

Here is a summary of my situation.  Diagnosed with prostate cancer 11/11 by my urologist with PSA at 17.4. Gleason 7. Began juicing especially carrots, apples, and oranges, eating kale, and juicing cucumbers, zucchini, green peppers and kiwi together. Continue today with this regime. Stopped milk, began almond/coconut milk instead. Eat fish, chicken, turkey main meats. Incorporate as many alkaline foods in diet as well.  Also intermittent use of maple syrup and BS, and molasses 10-12 days at one point but stopped.  </p>\n<p>CT and Bone scan 11/11 showed no metastasis although prostate gland was enlarged, but mostly smooth to the touch.    Believe my regime has had some benefit, although PSA is not down yet despite alternative holistic therapy (rose to 33.3). Second CT and Bone scan 12/12 also showed no metastasis.  Received hormone therapy 1/22/13; radiation therapy recommended to kill prostate (oncologist suggested 1/3 possibility micro spread possible, not and not picked up on CT and Bone scans) Radiation scheduled to begin 3/29/13; did not do this because wife&#8217;s health insurance ended).  </p>\n<p>Also during the period 11/12/-12/12 began Gerson coffee enemas and other of his therapy (juicing organic carrots an important one) weekly for detox to help immune system and liver function. Would like to go back on BS and Maple syrup because my sense is the Trojan horse therapy has some characteristics like chemo without the harshness and the hypothesis behind how the cancer cells would consume the sugar and release the BS which will kill the cells make intuitive sense, just like at Troy. Any insights on absorption of BS with the Trojan horse approach? It worked in Troy for sure.  Any evidence that Trojan horse approach actually gets the BS into those nasty cancer cells?  </p>\n<p>What are the odds that going full on the BS &amp; Maple syrup, will give favorable results? I will use include potassium supplement (have high BP and take Rx for that)? Some say urinary pH measure is not a good proxy for blood pH, and some says it is.  Not sure I buy that argument, but would interested in any insights.  I have also taken a prostate supplement by Dr. Ben Ong in the UK called Ben&#8217;s Total Health Supplement. </p>\n<p>I think not getting the radiation due to circumstances may be a blessing since the evidence of having sexual and other health related dysfunction issues is somewhat troubling, although I certainly do not want the cancer to spread at some point.  Lot to chew on here.  Thanks for your replies.  </p>\n<p>FYI I still bike ride and play a pretty good game of tennis.  Deep breathing 2x per day 20 minutes minimum. I am a 64 year old semi-retired university social scientist with a 12 year old son.  I am also a Christian (follower of Jesus Christ). Know he helps me every day as well.</p>\n<p>God bless.   </p>\n<p>Look forward to responses on this.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=10066#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-10066\", \"10066\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Dr. Herb Green'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-xzca001 odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-10486\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/52296d249d8ce40451990aa4655dd17e?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">xzca001</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-10486\">\n\t2013/05/06 at 4:18 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Hi, brother, God bless you, Amen!</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=10486#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-10486\", \"10486\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to xzca001'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-12526\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/33a9a0d9ea7731a5f582d7bba5687dec?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Libby</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-12526\">\n\t2013/10/19 at 3:33 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Hey, are you still progressing?

Get Alkaline &#8211; Change Acidic Cell Environment<br />\n I am not providing medical advice, simply \u201crevealing my experiences &amp; protocol\u201d, resulting in eliminating Stage IV Metasticised cancer.<br />\n I Did  \u201cNO\u201d Chemo, NO Radiation, a few Drugs. Takes 4 mos. To change our blood<br />\nMUST Do ORGANIC Plant Based Diet Alkaline-Rebuild Immune System 1st as CAUSE of Cancer is OVERWORKED Immune Function TOO MANY un-natural Chemicals in Foods!<br />\nAVOID Any forms of SUGAR-Eat Organic food-for about1 mo. then Initiate as follows:<br />\n\u2022\t1st day- 1 Teaspoon of BS soda with &amp; 1 cup room temp water 2x day (away from meals), 2 Teaspoons of Black Strap molasses (\u201cBSM\u201d) Heat @ \u201cLOW\u201d temp in pan for 5 min. STIR a lot to fully combine your sugar &amp; BSM into \u201cYOUR own Trojan Horse\u201d to benefit your body -immune system. The molasses/maple syrup targets cancer cells (which consume 15X more glucose than normal cells) &amp; the baking soda, (which is dragged into the cancer cell by the maple syrup/BSM), being very alkaline, is a rapid shift in pH thereby killing the cancer cells in hrs). We have 100 Trillion cells.<br />\n\u2022\t2nd day \u2013 repeat, also &#8220;DEEP breathing- 30x do 3-10x day&#8221; .  OXYGEN KILLS cancer cells<br />\n\u2022\t3rd day \u2013 same  Cancer cells thrive on sugar so when you use sugar it\u2019s like sending in \u201cyour own Trojan horse\u201d. The sugar is \u201cnot\u201d going to encourage the growth of the cancer colonies as the alkaline baking soda (9pH) is going to kill the cells before they have a chance to grow.<br />\n\u2022\t4th day \u2013 same  2X day goal get to 8.0 &#8211; 8.5 pH &amp; hold 4-5 days &amp;  cancer cells dormant @ pH 7.5+ &amp; kills cancer cells @ 7.8-8.6.  My pH was 8.53 on 3rd day with a blood &amp; urine test.<br />\n\u2022\t5th day &#8211; started taking the solution &#8211; 2 tspns BS &amp; 2 Tsps BSM 2X day<br />\n\u2022\t6th day\u2013 repeat 2 Tspns BS &amp; 2 Tspn of BSM &amp; 1 cup of water 2x a day. My pH measured 8.35. That is what happens with cesium chloride/BS done by Italian Dr. Simoncini, mild nausea is good as it means the dead cancer cells are being discarded by your body. BREATHE DEEPLY !<br />\n\u2022\t7th \u2013 All ok &#8211; lips tingled- an Oxygen Euphoria from a lot deep breathing. Oxygen assists in killing ALL cancer cells! Also on day 7, increased BS to 2+ Tspns. &amp; got a slight headache, backed off to 2 Tspns BS- I was a bit uncomfortable/nervous &amp; had a slight headache, so I reduced it. I had slight confusion.<br />\n              Do 30+ DEEP breaths MANY times per day\u2013 ERY IMPORTANT Oxygen kills cancer cells<br />\n\u2022\t8th day \u2013 double dose 3x a day to get pH high- could some be health issues with too much BS<br />\n      Potassium 200+mg intake is IMPORTANT. Filtered water also &amp;  Exercise/walk 30 min. daily.<br />\n\u2022\t9th day \u2013 A little diarrhea, a little weak feeling, really began to up my potassium intake.  All experts said that high dosage of potassium (also with cesium chloride) is very important. Oxygenation euphoria all day from deep breathing.  KILLING cancer cells most important !   Walk Barefoot on ground<br />\n\u2022\t10th day &#8211;  Headache more persistent, body sweats SO- I cut back to a solution 2x a day; not 3x.<br />\n\u2022\t11th day \u2013 down to 1.5 Tspns to control headache, bit of loose stools, slight headache &amp; night sweats. I cut back felt overloaded- 8.35 goal achieved &amp; I wanted to maintain pH 8.0+ for 4-5 days.<br />\n\u2022\t Key Points: Take BS solution 2 hrs before or 2 hrs after eating, to give stomach acids time to digest food. Eat HIGH potassium organic foods Watch blood pressure-take Potassium. </p>\n<p>Calcium 1,200 mg<br />\nVit.

While there are some remarkable stories reported, there are also many people who seem to get negative results. Dr Carey Reams used a more complex method of testing outputs than just PH.  He  added urine nitrates, urea, and ammonia as well as Albumin and Brix. He found that at times all he had do was alkalinize with lemon juice. I suspect those who don&#8217;t respond simply need something else than BS/MS to balance the body.</p>\n<p>One suggestion would be to use black strap/BS for a month, then follow up with Artemisinin from Artemesia Annua(Sweet Annie). Many cancers concentrate iron which reacts with the Artemisinin to produce enough free radicals inside the cells to kill the cancer. There has been quite a bit of success reported in Asia with Artemisinin.  If you manage to load up the cancer cells with iron, but not kill them with the BS-BSM mix, maybe the Artemisinin will get them.</p>\n<p>One curious consequence of the Sodium Carbonate may be that it combines with the acid released locally by the cancer cells, forming CO2. Carbon dioxide is a powerful vasodilator that may greatly increase the arterial blood flow to the area. This may allow the immune system to do its work and also help normalize the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>Most of the successful reports seem to indicate people who did a wide variety of other things, with BS/MS adding a significant positive component.<br />\nI am not a cancer patient, but have a brother who is trying it. I don&#8217;t think he is doing it right though. He is at present taking 3 tsp of BS(ironic abbreviation, no?) per day. At one point this morning his PH tested 5.5   I think he will have to increase his intake to have a positive impact.

Your question is not clearly written, but I think you are concerned because after starting the Trojan Horse protocol, the appearance of wrinkles in breast skin seems to indicate breast tissue shrinkage.  I would not consider myself a pro, but I do know that much can get trapped because we wear bras etc. This is an area that can and should have much lymphatic flow since the lymph system runs right around that area. It could be that your system is cleaning out. After you are done with the protocol, I  have a simple suggestion that may help tighten that skin back up. Good luck. I wish the best for you.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=14311#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-14311\", \"14311\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to wendyk21'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-14314\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://i2.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/100000115758759/picture?q=type%3Dlarge%26_md5%3D6a5d95f538810d07d4307b5163b07f03&#038;resize=32%2C32' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='https://www.facebook.com/don.porter.37' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Don Porter</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-14314\">\n\t2014/01/08 at 3:20 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>MANY  Dr. Otto Warburg 1931 Noel Prize winner, thousand of others, MANY Books ie: Recalled by Life by  Anthony J.

Let&#8217;s look at these claims one by one:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Germs consume sugar to generate energy and grow but it cannot live in an alkaline body.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a common myth that just refuses to die regardless of all the solid evidence to the contrary.  Most pathogens THRIVE in an alkaline environment and are killed by acidity.  For example, the blood is kept in an alkaline state except in super rare circumstances.  If pathogens cannot survive in an alkaline environment then how do so many people get sick from pathogens?  One of the various roles of stomach acid is to kill ingested pathogens. The ulcer and  cancer forming pathogen Helicobacter pylori secretes highly alkaline ammonia to maintain the alkaline environment it requires to survive.  Bacteria that cause urinary tract infections secrete the enzyme urease to alkalize the urine since they also need an alkaline environment to survive and thrive. The beneficial flora that inhabit our bodies produce acids that among other things kill pathogens. These acids also keep the dimorphic microbe Candida albicans in its benign yeast form.  In an alkaline environment the Candida growth gene is turned on and the Candida morphs in to its pathogenic fungal form.

My ORAL and urine pH was around 6.2. Desired is 7.4. Too high is 8.2+.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Diet does not make us acidic.  Although ALL foods eventually metabolize in to acids many of these acids are essential to the body. But pH is tightly regulated primarily by respiration followed by hydrogen ion retention or elimination by the kidneys.  Therefore, acidity and alkalinity are tightly regulated regardless of what we eat.

Same with salivary pH.  Salivary pH is affected by the amount of bacteria in the mouth so things such as brushing your teeth will make the saliva more alkaline.  So will drinking water, thinking of certain foods, etc.  Dry mouth increases acidity as alkaline saliva normally washes away acid forming bacteria in the mouth.  Urinary pH is affected by hydration levels, certain supplements and medications and by bacteria in the urine.  Urinary tract infections lead to highly alkaline urine as the bacteria use the enzyme urease to split urea in to highly alkaline ammonia. The alkalinity helps the bacteria, as with most pathogens, to survive.  The ONLY way to determine blood pH is with a blood test.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An acidic pH can occur from, an acid forming diet, emotional stress, toxic overload, and/or immune reactions or any process that deprives the cells of oxygen and other nutrients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The only part of this entire statement that has any truth to it is the cells deprived of oxygen part, which can increase acidity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The body will try to compensate for acidic pH by using alkaline minerals. If the diet does not contain enough minerals to compensate, a build up of acids in the cells will occur.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alkaline minerals are only used as a last resort.  This would require severe, prolonged acidosis.  This is so rare that most people will never meet anyone in their entire lives that has ever experienced this level of acidosis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An acidic balance will: decrease the body\u2019s ability to absorb minerals and other nutrients,&#8221;</p>\n<p>Actually just the opposite.  Minerals and various vitamins such as B6, B12 and folate are all acid dependent for absorption.  This is why alkaline minerals such as calcium carbonate (oyster shell, dolomite, coral) and magnesium oxide are so poorly absorbed. And why when people have a lack of stomach acid from aging, use of antacids, acid blockers, drinking ionized alkaline water, ingesting baking soda, etc. end up with nutritional deficiencies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;decrease the energy production in the cells,&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again completely wrong.  Cellular energy production is dependent on a variety of acids including citric, malic and pyruvic acids.  Basic human physiology.  In addition, the delivery of oxygen to cells, required for energy production, is also acid dependent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;decrease it\u2019s ability to repair damaged cells&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wrong for the same reason listed above.  Repairing of cells requires proper cellular energy production, which is acid dependent and methylation, which needs sufficient stomach acid for the absorption of the required nutrients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;decrease it\u2019s ability to detoxify heavy metals&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again not true. One of the body&#8217;s primary detoxifiers is glucuronic acid.</p>\n<p>&#8220;make tumor cells thrive&#8221;</p>\n<p>Misleading.  Cancer cells have a higher internally alkalinity than healthy cells.  Cancer cells need this alkalinity to survive and thrive. Therefore, cancer cells rapidly export acidic hydrogen ions (protons) in to the external matrix to maintain their alkalinity.  These protons and the high amount of carbon dioxide produced lead to a slightly acidity external environment immediately around the tumor.   It is this EXTERNAL acidity that promotes metastases, but alkalinity DOES NOT kill already alkaline cancer cells.  Acidity kills cancer cells.

A BLOOD pH of 6.9, which is only slightly acidic, can induce coma and death.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A slight rise in alkalinity above normal can also lead to coma and death.  For example, liver failure can lead to a build up of highly alkaline and highly toxic ammonia leading to coma an death.  A high pH can also kill a person from a lack of cellular oxygenation due to inhibition of oxygen release, decreased circulation and suffocation from spasm contractions of the lungs preventing respiration.  This is why the body has various redundant systems to maintain its pH.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By taking 1-2 tsp of Maple Syrup/Baking Soda regularly, I can maintain oral and urine pH around 7.4-7.8. This is the easiest way to boost pH in my body. If you have problems digesting food due to chemo and high pH, take some digestive enzymes and probiotics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This does not alter blood pH since again the body already maintains an alkaline blood pH.  If you were able to raise it any higher then you would die for the reasons explained above.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=18417#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-18417\", \"18417\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to James'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-18610\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f20fb1f429b6841101b57fc2cc3c8fcb?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Sharon Webb</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-18610\">\n\t2015/01/18 at 12:19 pm</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>On day 4 of maple syrup and baking soda for stage 4 lung cancer.

It never healed but just got worse.  All the doctors said it was damaged muscle and would take a long time to heal.  In Peru we did quite a lot of walking.  Roy bought a cane but after using it several days his rib cage was more sore than his hip.  He figured it was sore muscles that he hadn\u2019t been using.  When we got home in Feb. we had a huge snow storm and the snow plow broke our mailbox post.  It was a 4 by 4 post set 2- 3 feet into the ground.  He had to dig that out and replace it.  That made his back very sore.  Again he thought it was sore muscles.  He could hardly lift while doing appliance installs for Lowe\u2019s and had to hire help.  Every day he came home in terrible pain.  His orthopedic doctor ordered therapy 3 times a week.  By the end of May, Roy &amp; the therapist agreed that it didn\u2019t seem to be helping.  All of a sudden Roy had started losing weight.  Nothing tasted good, not even sweets &amp; he had no appetite.   He lost about 50 lbs. &amp; his muscles just melted away.  He went for a complete physical and had a PSA of 1,170 !  He was sent to a urologist.   He scheduled a bone scan &amp; a prostate biopsy.   On June 10, 2014 the bone scan showed cancer in \u201cinnumerable\u201d places on his shoulders, spine, ribs, hip &amp; skull, etc. and of course the biopsy revealed cancer\u2014a stage 4 Very Aggressive prostate cancer that had metastasized to the bones.<br />\nHe said there was no cure but with hormone treatment he might buy some time.<br />\n One doctor said a very slow growing, non threatening prostate cancer can be activated by a trauma. Perhaps the hip damage was the trauma.   (His previous PSA test was 3.5)  The pain in his back was so severe that he could hardly climb stairs &amp; he wasn\u2019t sleeping well.  I had been gently rubbing his back &amp; rib cage with magnesium gel (a muscle relaxer) and reading him to sleep at night.  On Father\u2019s day Carolyn &amp; family came to our house because Roy was unable to go to theirs.  She was shocked when she saw how her dad had deteriorated, skin &amp; bones, no strength, no color, and in a lot of pain, despite pain medication.   Providentially about that time a local friend called to ask if Roy could do an electrical job for him.   He told us all about going to MD Anderson in Houston for his prostate cancer &amp; encouraged Roy to go there.  He told Dr. Corn, his doctor in Houston, all </p>\n<p>-2</p>\n<p>about Roy .  Dr. Corn called us and talked to us about a relatively new hormone treatment called Degaralex that slows the growth of cancer. </p>\n<p>He said that unless Roy got that shot immediately he would probably live no more than 3 weeks.<br />\nBecause of complications getting a local oncologist it was now July 3rd, the eve of a holiday.  Dr. Corn spent 2 hours trying to find a local Dr. that would give the shot, including the doctor at the emergency room.  He never got even one doctor to answer his phone.  Providentially, a few days before Dr. Corn called, the minister who preached for Roy in 2008 when he had his jaw surgery called from VA, where he now pastors, and wanted to come to Brevard and have a prayer service for Roy with the elders of our church, following the James chapter 5 instructions.  The day after that prayer service, I went to the health food store met a man who gave me the name &amp; phone number of his friend, Don Porter, who had the same cancer as Roy 7+ years ago &amp; is now healthy &amp; cancer free at age 77.  He is from Florida and New England but has a summer home in Cashiers (a half hour up the mountain where Roy did electrical work).  When Dr. Corn couldn\u2019t find a doctor to give Roy the Degaralex shot, I asked him if he wanted to call Don Porter.  Roy said, \u201cYes,\u2014 at least we can do something.\u201d  Don came down on July 4th and spent 3 hours with us explaining the baking soda protocol, Oxygen, Green teas, Herbal Aloe Force and the diet he had followed that brought back his health and the reasons why it all works, and he was the picture of health.  Don said that Oxygen will kill Roy&#8217;s cancer and wanted Roy to do a real lot of deep breathing. He also spoke to Roy about rebuilding the God given miracle that Roy had, that was his Immune System.  Once Roy killed the cancer with high alkalinity that he had to rebuild all those cells and bone with his regenerated immune system. Don said that high alkalinity meant that more oxygen would go into Roy&#8217;s cells and along with lots of deep breathing Roy would kill his cancer and then be able to rebuild all those cancer areas. He mentioned Dr. Otto Heinrich Warburg 1931 Nobel Prize Winner for discovering this, and The Real Cause of Cancer ,and he brought some books &#8211; Recalled by Life and Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy.<br />\nDon was very eloquent and convincing, and  I said I wanted the approval of our children so I called Carolyn and Don explained the whole protocol, diet and everything to her.  Roy agreed to give it a try &amp; Carolyn agreed to help me get the food &amp; fix it (an all organic whole foods diet plus some supplements, a set menu for a week, repeated each week).  Don said we did need to get the hormone shot as soon as possible.    Roy started the baking soda protocol that evening\u2014an 11 day protocol.  The theory he focused on was that is that cancer cannot live in an alkaline environment but thrives in an acidic environment.  Baking soda is very alkaline.  The baking soda protocol will temporarily raise Roy&#8217;s alkalinity (urine and saliva tests show)  as it takes 4 months to change Roy&#8217;s blood. The Baking Soda high alkalinity is to kill existing cancer and the diet is designed to build the immune system to make, then keep, the body healthy and alkaline. Don gave us a LONG list of things that Roy was NOT to eat, (his &#8220;NO&#8221; chemical foods) primarily packaged foods, fast foods, red meat, sodas, and really wanted Roy to try to eat only organic. Some of the foods, green teas were chinese and hard to find. Don also wanted us to throw away most of the vitamins, and more, that we had accumulated, and focus on very specific herbs like Theracurmn, Resveratrol, Astralagus, etc.<br />\nCarolyn &amp; I went ) shopping that night and got as much food as we could get locally in a store that stayed open all night (even on July 4th), she got the rest of it the next day, and the following day (Sunday) came after church &amp; stayed till midnight steaming vegetables and getting meals fixed &amp; labeled for a week.  Roy started the diet with supper on Sunday the July 6th.  By July 9th Roy&#8217;s pain was nearly gone and July 10th all pain gone (no more pain medication at all). Carolyn is an excellent cook and is very fast and organized. Roy finally got the Degaralex shot on July 15 to stop the production of Testosterone which Don said feeds prostate cancer.  This drug lasts one month.  Dr. Pollock, the local oncologist, said the drug might cause osteoporosis and wanted to give him another drug to strengthen bones, but one of the side effects was deterioration of the jaw bone.  (Roy only has one jaw bone since the other was replaced with pelvic bone in 2008.)  He also wanted to give Chemo treatments.  Roy declined those two options.   Dr Pollock said Roy would feel worse for a week or two while his body reacted against the new drug, but in 2 days Roy was feeling much better.  (He had just finished the baking soda protocol.)  By the time Scott arrived from Peru for our anniversary celebration Roy was up &amp; around helping him do jobs.   On August 14th Roy got his 2nd shot and PSA test.  Dr Pollock said that if the PSA came down to 700 he got a \u201cC\u201d,  if it was 500 he got an \u201cA\u201d.  Everyone was VERY shocked to hear that it had come down to 45.<br />\nOn Sept 15, 2014 he went to MD Anderson in Houston to see the Dr. that ordered the first Degaralex shot (given by a local oncologist).  However MD Anderson set him up to see a different Dr. who tried his best to talk him into doing chemo, which Roy resisted.  They did blood work and said he was anemic.  They did a prostate exam and said his prostate was no longer enlarged or hard.  They did another bone scan and said it still showed cancer in his bones.  Then they gave him another hormone shot called Lupron, which lasts for 3 months.  These shots tell the brain not to make testosterone. The MD Anderson Drs. were really quite shocked at Roy&#8217;s reversal . The PSA had dropped to 17 and his prostate was no longer enlarged &amp; hard.    In October the PSA had dropped to 10.  Roy has continued to make a complete turnaround.  His pain is long gone without any pain medication, just Herbal Aloe Force, diet and deep breathing, his color is good, he has quit losing weight, has a good appetite &amp; is enjoying food again (still on the diet for the most part though \u201ccheating\u201d now and then)\u2019 and is sleeping very well.  He feels like being productive and has done a lot of home repairs, hauls wood for the furnace &amp; keeps it going, walks a half hour/day &amp; does exercises to build back his muscles.  Carolyn still comes one day a week, brings most of the food and steams all the vegetables for the week.  She also bakes the salmon for 4 meals.  I am usually in therapy while Carolyn is here so she &amp; Roy get all the meals for the week packaged and labeled (Mon. lunch, Mon. snack, Mon. dinner, etc.) and  put in the frig or freezer.   I have all the organic beans, brown &amp; wild rice, quinoa, lentils, etc. for the week cooked before Carolyn gets here so that the labeled meals contain everything needed for that meal.<br />\nHe still drinks the Green teas, takes the Aloe Force 3 times/ day, and takes the supplements you suggested.  He still does the filtered water and stays away from the acidic chemical foods.  John K. told him to eat broccoli sprouts so he does eat a salad using alkaline veggies (cucumber, celery, spinach &amp; mixed greens with the sprouts with no dressing (except sometimes fresh made guacamole) but grinds a little organic peppercorns on his salad.  I have been trying to add more green foods to the diet (when it calls for broccoli or chard or kale I add extra) but that doesn\u2019t seem to bring the ph up.<br />\nWe are especially thankful for the gift of God &#8211; Don Porter:  Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Again there are numerous things that can affect urinary pH including dehydration, urinary tract infection, some medications, etc, all while the blood is still being maintained within its normal range.

I tried everything and it&#8217;s in my bones now I  started as stage 2 breast cancer in December 2014 while I was pumping at work, for my new born baby boy. I noticed my right breast would bleed drops of blood each time. I thought it was mastitis at first, I have been loosing hope for a while, but here on night number 1, I am already holding my p.h. at 7.5 on night one, I am elated! Thankyou God, I have 6 children from 16 yrs down to 11 months it&#8217;s been real triasome with the bone pain in my femurs! It&#8217;s also all throughout my lungs and lympatic  system! Thankfully I accidentally scrambled across the baking soda video, I&#8217;m on Board now! Yippee! I feel all in a great mood, it&#8217;s the first thing to move my p.h. in 7 months now all in one night! Wow I have literally tried everything and this simple house hold item works wow!! If this doesn&#8217;t give people hope, I don&#8217;t know what will, I&#8217;m outta options and I am sick of breathing treatments every morning and night. I hope someone else benifits from this besides me :&amp;)) God bless simple!</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t<a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/?replytocom=18967#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-18967\", \"18967\", \"respond\", \"107\" )' aria-label='Reply to Annie'>Reply</a>\t</div>\n<ul class=\"children\">\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment\" id=\"comment-18968\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04220e06cf78b08ccbc6ec07e3c628ce?s=32&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' />\t<h3 class=\"commenttitle\"><cite class=\"fn\">Annie</cite> <span class=\"says\">said</span></h3>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<small class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"https://truthpills.wordpress.com/health/maple-syrupbaking-soda-trojan-horse/#comment-18968\">\n\t2015/07/12 at 8:56 am</a> </small>\n\n\t<p>Hi it&#8217;s Annie, I&#8217;ve noticed a difference in the pink Himalayan Rock Salt, you soak it for over 24 hours and you ingest a couple teaspoons a day of the fresh mineral water it mks you have energy!

He was Interstitial Lung Disease and a malignant cyst in his lung and as ILD is there he could not be operated or given radio therapy and only chemo therapy was an option. I even tried the Baking soda and maple syrup protocol for 12 days. After 3 chemo his cyst has reduced 50%. He has small cell carcinoma and i believe it is dangerous. Doctors said if treatment works then 2 years. I am scared will try anything that could help.<br />\nWould be grateful if you could let me know, after 12 days protocol how much rest should be given and then when should i start the protocol and what interval gap to be given between the protocols. Eagerly waiting for guidance.
