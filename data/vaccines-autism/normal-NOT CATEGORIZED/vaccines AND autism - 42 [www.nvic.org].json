Look At An Old Story</h1>\r\n        <h2><br /></h2>\r\n\t<span id=\"ctl00_plcMain_lblPostedDate\"></span>\r\n            <p><em>This report on vaccines and autism was published in 2000 in The Vaccine Reaction newsletter published by NVIC between 1995 and 2005 and mailed to NVIC supporters .  This report was the first major review of evidence that vaccines can cause acute and chronic brain inflammation leading to neurological dysfunction associated with regressive autism.</em></p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">The connection between vaccination and   autistic behavior, first reported in DPT: A Shot in the Dark (Coulter &amp;   Fisher, 1985) fifteen years ago and now being discussed in the medical   literature, has finally entered the U.S. public arena after simmering for more   than a decade. This enhanced public awareness has been fueled by persistent   reports by parents in the U.S., Canada and Europe that their children were   healthy, bright and happy until they received one or more vaccines and then   descended into the isolated, painful world of autism marked by chronic immune   and neurological dysfunction, including repetitive and uncontrollable behavior.   Conservative estimates are that about 500,000 Americans are autistic but that   number is growing daily, with new evidence that perhaps as many as 1 in 150   children are suffering from autism spectrum disorder that can include a range of   neurological, behavior and immune system dysfunction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, as states revealed skyrocketing rates of   autism spectrum disorder among children and a congressional hearing was held in   the U.S. Congress, the media began to explore the medical controversy in print   and broadcast reports. At the heart of the debate stand a few courageous   physicians whose independent, multi-disciplinary approach to investigating the   possible biological mechanisms of vaccine-induced autism is serving as a   counterweight to the steadfast denials by infectious disease specialists and   government health officials defending current mass vaccination policies. As   scientific evidence reveals that a portion of autism lies on the vaccine injury   spectrum, parents determined to find help for their children are turning to   doctors exploring diet and immune modulating therapies.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>The Past Is Prologue</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents of now grown vaccine injured children, who   warned pediatricians and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) officials in the   1980&rsquo;s that their once healthy, bright children regressed mentally, emotionally   and physically after reacting to DPT vaccine with fever, high pitched screaming   (encephalitic cry), collapse/shock, and seizures, are grieving with a new   generation of parents whose healthy, bright children suddenly regress after   DPT/DTaP, MMR, hepatitis B, polio, Hib and chicken pox vaccinations. The refusal   two decades ago by vaccine manufacturers, government health agencies and medical   organizations to seriously investigate reports of vaccine-associated brain   injury and immune system dysfunction, including autistic behaviors, is reaping   tragic consequences today.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now parents of old and young vaccine injured   children in the U.S. and Europe are joining with enlightened doctors in a   rejection of the unscientific a priori assumption that a child&rsquo;s mental,   physical and emotional regression after vaccination is only coincidentally but   not causally related to the vaccines recently given. They are calling for   credible basic science research into the biological mechanism of vaccine adverse   events to develop pathological profiles which will separate health problems   caused by vaccines from those that are not; the development of screening   techniques to identify children at genetic or other biological risk of   developing vaccine-induced health problems; the institution of informed consent   protections in vaccination laws; re-examination of vaccine licensing standards;   and an end to one-size-fits-all vaccination policies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This, while the U.S. government, the pharmaceutical   industry and international corporate interests announced on March 2, 2000 the   creation of a new multi-billion dollar alliance called the Millennium Vaccine   Initiative (MVI) to vaccinate all of the world&rsquo;s children with existing and new   vaccines, including those being targeted for accelerated development for AIDS,   tuberculosis and malaria. According to the annual NIH Jordan Report, there are   more than 200 vaccines in various research stages. Dozens are under   consideration for childhood use. Even as the race to add new vaccines to the   routine child vaccination schedule rushes forward, parents, whose children   became autistic after receiving existing vaccines, are changing the direction of   autism research and the vaccine safety debate.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Increase in Autism Reflects Real   Increases in Childhood Chronic Diseases and Disability</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of autism, like that of learning   disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, diabetes,   arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and other   autoimmune and neurological disorders, has risen dramatically in the U.S. and   other technologically advanced countries, while high vaccination rates have   caused the incidence of childhood infectious diseases to fall just as   dramatically in these countries. Instead of epidemics of infectious disease,   there are now epidemics of chronic disease.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A University of California study published by the   U.S. Department of Education in 1996 found that &quot;The proportion of the US   population with disabilities has risen markedly during the past quarter-century   . . . this recent change seems to be due not to demographics, but to greater   numbers of children and young adults reported as having disabilities.&quot; The study   concluded that &quot;these changes may be partly accounted for by the increases in   the prevalence of asthma, mental disorders (including attention deficit   disorder), mental retardation, and learning disabilities that have been noted   among children in recent years.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Autoimmunity Epidemic</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After heart disease and cancer, autoimmune disease   has become the third leading cause of illness in the United States and in many   technologically advanced countries. According to the American Academy of   Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), the autoimmune disease, asthma, is now   &quot;the most common disorder in children and adolescents, affecting nearly five   million children under the age of 18, including an estimated 1.3 million   children under the age of five. Fifty to 80 percent of children affected with   asthma develop symptoms before they are five years old.&quot;   (http://www.aaaai.org).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1997 study published in Science found that asthma   has doubled in prevalence in Western societies during the past 20 years and in   the United States causes one-third of pediatric emergency room visits. A 1995   report by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated that between 1982 and   1992, asthma increased 52 percent for persons between 5 and 34 years old and   asthma deaths increased 42 percent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another autoimmune disorder, arthritis, is also &quot;on   a steady rise&quot; according to the CDC in 1998, which estimated that arthritis now   plagues more than 40 million Americans and projected that the number will grow   to 60 million by 2020. Cases of diabetes, yet another chronic autoimmune   disorder, have tripled in the U.S. since 1958, now affecting nearly 16 million   Americans and ranking fourth in the leading causes of death in America. The CDC   concluded in 1997 that &quot;the number of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes was   almost 50 percent higher in 1994 than in 1980&quot; and did not appear to be a result   of the aging of the population.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, a new report issued by the EURODIAB   study group (Lancet-2000), evaluated the incidence rate of diabetes from 1989 to   1994 in Europe and Israel and found a 63 percent increase in children under 5   years old; a 31 percent increase in children five to nine years old; and a 24   percent increase in children 10 to 14 years old. They said, &quot;The rapid rate of   increase in children under 5 years old is of particular concern.&quot; There is no   explanation for why adult-onset diabetes, once extremely rare in children, has   become more prevalent in American children in the past ten years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to an unexplained increase in   autoimmune disorders during the past three decades, there also has been an   unexplained dramatic increase in the numbers of minimally brain damaged children   who are filling special education classrooms in schools across   America.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Minimal Brain Damage Epidemic</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A disability survey of U.S. children under 17 years   old in 1991&ndash;1992 published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (August   25, 1995) stated that the &quot;6 to 14 year old age group had the greatest number of   disabled people.&quot; Learning disability led the way, occurring in nearly 30   percent of all disabled children. A total of 1,435,000 children were listed as   learning disabled with another 1,446,000 children reported as suffering from   speech disorders, mental retardation, mental or emotional disorders, epilepsy   and autism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Digest of Education Statistics looked at   children 0 to 21 years old served in federally supported programs for the   disabled between 1976 and 1996 and found that the numbers of children with   specific learning disabilities more than tripled in those years; those with   serious emotional disturbances nearly doubled; and the numbers of autistic   children served rose from 5,000 in 1991&ndash;92 to 39,000 in 1995&ndash;1996 to produce a   staggering 680 percent increase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ADHD Epidemic</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;About five percent of U.S. school children (at   least two million children) are now estimated to have attention deficit disorder   (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). According to Sears and   Thompson (1998), a 1990 survey of 2,400 practicing physicians showed there were   about two million patient visits associated with the diagnoses of ADD and by   1994, it had increased to 4.7 million, with 90 percent of the visits resulting   in drug therapy. By 1995, there were 1.5 million children taking Ritalin and in   a recent study (Zito, JAMA) it was reported that the number of two to four year   olds taking prescription drugs like Ritalin and Prozac rose 50 percent between   1991 and 1995.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one NIH official, 40 percent of   children diagnosed with ADHD have learning disabilities and &quot;anywhere from 20 to   70 percent of children who have ADHD also have conduct disorder&quot; often involving   delinquent behavior (www.intelihealth.com). The growing numbers of children with   an ADHD diagnosis is cause for concern because, as one researcher observed in   1988: &quot;Adults with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder appear   to be over represented in the ranks of felons.&quot; (Cowart, JAMA).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1990 book Vaccination, Social Violence and   Criminality, medical historian Harris Coulter, Ph.D., expands on the evidence he   and Barbara Loe Fisher first presented in DPT: A Shot in the Dark and draws   parallels between the residual learning disabilities and hyperactive/abnormal   behavior caused by complications of disease or vaccine-induced encephalitis and   the hyperactive/abnormal behavior and learning disabilities being exhibited by   more and more American children.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many children with learning disabilities, ADHD and   developmental delays exhibit signs of autoimmune dysfunction, with severe   allergies to foods, drugs, and environmental toxins. (Geschwind, 1982; Geschwind   &amp; Behan, 1982; Colgan &amp; Colgan, 1984; Boris &amp; Marvin, 1994). In her   book, Is This Your Child&rsquo;s World?, Doris Rapp, M.D. documents compelling   evidence for the association between allergies, learning disabilities and   ADHD.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Autism Epidemic</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to the concern of a Dad, whose healthy   son became autistic following a series of DPT, Hib and MMR vaccinations, in 1998   the California Legislature decided to analyze the history of autism in the   state. Rick Rollens, father of two, former Secretary of the California Senate,   and co-founder of F.E.A.T. (Families for Early Autism Treatment &mdash;   (http://www.feat.org) and the University of California-Davis M.I.N.D. Institute,   persuaded the legislature to fund an investigation by the California Department   of Developmental Services (DDS) into state autism statistics after he concluded   his son, Russell, now 9, was not the victim of a rare disorder but one that had   become quite common in children.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>California Autism Rates Soar</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, in an April 1999 report   (http://www.dds.ca.gov) DDS found a 273 percent increase between 1987 and 1998   in the numbers of new children entering the California developmental services   system with a professional diagnosis of autism. The report concluded that &quot;the   number of persons with autism grew markedly faster than the number of persons   with other developmental disabilities (cerebral palsy, epilepsy and mental   retardation)&quot; and &quot;compared to characteristics of 11 years ago, the present   population of persons with autism are younger (and) have a greater chance of   exhibiting no or milder forms of mental retardation. . . .&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although autism has been cited by public health   officials and autism researchers to occur in 2 to 10 in 10,000 children   nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control in a report released in April 2000   found the incidence of autism in Brick Township, New Jersey in 1998 was 1 in 150   children (the incidence in the Granite Bay, California public elementary school   district is 1 in 132 children), which may be more reflective of the true rate of   autism in the U.S. today. The Autism Society of America estimates that &quot;more   than one-half million people in the U.S. today have autism or some form of   pervasive developmental disorder,&quot; making autism one of the most common   developmental disabilities. (http://www/autism-society.org)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the California report documented the dramatic   increases in autism in the past decade, the California legislature voted to   appropriate one million dollars to the UC-Davis M.I.N.D. Institute to look for   environmental and biological factors, including vaccine use, that could have   contributed to this autism increase. At the same time, parents began to check   autism statistics in other states.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Other States Report Similar Increases</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is the same in other states. The 1998   Maryland Special Education Census Data revealed that the state experienced a 513   percent increase in autism between 1993 and 1998, while the general Maryland   population from 1990 to 1998 increased just seven percent. A comparative   analysis of the 16th and 20th Annual Reports to Congress on the implementation   of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) conducted by Ray   Gallup, President of Autism Autoimmunity Project (http://www.gti.net/truegrit)   and father of Eric, who has vaccine-associated autism, showed increases of more   than 300 percent in autistic children served under IDEA between 1992 and 1997 in   the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,   Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New   Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,</p>\r\n<p>Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,   Vermont, and Wisconsin.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p align=\"center\">New Behavior Disorder Blamed On Bad   Parenting</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain and immune system dysfunction diagnosed   in previously healthy children after viral and bacterial infections or   vaccination complications, documented in the medical literature, parallels the   brain and immune system dysfunction suffered by previously healthy children who   become autistic. But it took nearly forty years for the medical profession to   agree that the cause of a child&rsquo;s autistic behavior was not to be found by   putting Mom on the psychiatrist&rsquo;s couch but by looking in the microscope at the   cells, molecules and genes &mdash; by evaluating the biological basis for the   constellation of physical, emotional and mental symptoms which were first called   childhood schizophrenia and now have come to be known as autism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1943, when child psychiatrist Leo Kanner first   described 11 cases of a new mental illness in children he said was distinguished   by self absorbed detachment from other people and repetitive and bizarre   behavior, he used the word &quot;autistic&quot; (from the Greek word auto, meaning   &quot;self.&quot;) Pointing out similarities with some behaviors exhibited by adult   schizophrenics, Kanner and other psychiatrists assumed autistic children were   exhibiting early-onset adult-type psychoses.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Education, I.Q. and &quot;Refrigerator   Moms&quot;</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanner&rsquo;s young patients came from well-educated   middle and upper class families in Baltimore with mothers and fathers who were   doctors, lawyers and professors. In 1954, Kanner said, &quot;we have not encountered   any one autistic child who came of unintelligent parents.&quot; This concentration of   autistic children in educated and professionally successful families led Kanner   to develop the &quot;refrigerator Mom&quot; theory as the cause of autism, theorizing that   the warm maternal instincts of educated working mothers was absent or   diminished. Embracing the popular psychiatric, Freudian themes echoed by Kanner,   for decades pediatricians were persuaded to blame mothers of autistic children   for being cold and emotionally rejecting, causing the children in turn to coldly   reject contact with other people.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1954, Kanner had started to modify his &quot;Blame   the Mother&quot; stance in recognition that the brothers and sisters of autistic   children were often well adjusted, high functioning children and suggested that   the development of autism was also a result of genetic or &quot;constitutional   inadequacies&quot; as well as bad parenting. By 1971, Kanner admitted Mom was not to   blame.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the damage had already been done. The rejecting   parent theme was taken up by psychoanalyst Bruno Bettleheim in various books and   articles, such as The Empty Fortress (1967). Bettleheim insisted the autistic   child was behaving in abnormal ways in retaliation against a rejecting mother   who had traumatized the child by failing to provide enough love or   attention.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>A Father Shows The Way</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as Bettleheim&rsquo;s influence was growing, a   California psychologist and father of an autistic child, Bernard Rimland, Ph.D.,   already had taken on the psychiatric establishment which had dominated autism   research and treatment. In his landmark book Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and   Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior published in 1964, Rimland   methodically dismantled the psychoanalytic theory of autism and argued for a   biological, specifically a neurological, basis for autistic behavior. He   documented the similarities between brain injured children and autistic   children, liberating parents from the destructive guilt associated with having   an autistic child and pointing autism research in the direction it should always   have taken: investigation into the biological mechanisms underlying the brain   and immune dysfunction symptoms and their possible causes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After founding the Autism Society of America (ASA)   in 1965 and establishing the Autism Research Institute (ARI) in 1967, Rimland   began distributing a questionnaire to parents of autistic children. Some 33   years later, his databank includes information on more than 30,000 cases of   autism from around the world. In analyzing the data for age of onset of autism,   he discovered that before the early 1980&rsquo;s, most of the parents reported their   children first showed signs of abnormal behavior at birth or in the first year   of life. But after the mid-1980&rsquo;s, there was a reversal of this pattern. The   numbers of parents reporting that their children developed normally in the first   year and a half of life and then, suddenly, became autistic, doubled. Today,   said Rimland, &quot;the onset-at-18 months children outnumber the onset-at-birth   children by 2 to 1.&quot; (http://www.autism.com/ari)</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Class, Vaccines and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimland, like Kanner, noticed early in his research   that autistic children often came from intelligent, well-educated parents who   were successful professionals in their communities. Upper middle class families   in America have always sought out and received quality medical care. Children,   whose parents are well educated are the most likely to take full advantage of   the latest developments in medicine. This would have been especially true in   Kanner&rsquo;s day as two miracle drugs of the 20th century &mdash; antibiotics and new   vaccines &mdash; elevated trust in and reliance upon pharmaceuticals to a new   plateau.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1940&rsquo;s, state-of-the-art pediatric   medical care would have included a smallpox vaccination plus a separate dose of   diphtheria vaccine. In 1944, pertussis vaccine was recommended for all babies.   By 1947, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended routine use of the   new combination DPT vaccine. By 1958, Kanner&rsquo;s case files contained more than   100 cases of autism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, M.S. and W.C. Goodwin reported a dramatic   upsurge of autism cases in their pediatric psychiatric practice after 1964. By   1964, the well-cared-for American child was getting simultaneously vaccinated   with DPT as well as polio vaccine at two, four, six and 18 months of age (the   inactivated polio (IPV) was licensed in 1955 and the live virus oral polio (OPV)   vaccine was licensed in 1963). After 1959, more than three million children were   injected with the combination DPT-IPV shot (Quadrigen) before it was pulled off   the market in 1968 for safety and efficacy reasons. By the mid-1960&rsquo;s, many   state-of-the-art pediatric practices were also giving babies the new live virus   measles vaccine, which had been licensed in 1963 and was routinely used by   1965.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>More Vaccines and More Vaccinations</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1979, a combination live virus   measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which was licensed in 1971, had been added   to the routine child vaccination schedule and given to children at 12 to 15   months of age; federal grants were being given to states to provide free DPT,   polio and MMR vaccines to children in public health clinics; and the CDC was   encouraging states to enforce mandatory vaccination laws to raise national   vaccination rates. By 1979, rubella vaccine, which had been licensed in 1969 for   use in children also began to be routinely administered to mothers in hospitals   after giving birth (Preblud, 1985; Tingle, 1986).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, the CDC added haemophilus influenza b   (Hib) vaccine to the child vaccine schedule; in 1991 the CDC recommended the   recombinant hepatitis B vaccine be used by all newborn infants and children; in   1993 the combined DPTH vaccine was licensed; and in 1995, the live varicella   zoster (chicken pox) vaccine was put on the market.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Almost Three Dozen Doses By Age Five</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the average American child regardless of   the parent&rsquo;s educational level or ability to pay was being injected with   hepatitis B vaccine at 12 hours of age and 1 month; with DPT or DTaP, Hib, OPV   or IPV at two and four months; with DPT/DTaP, Hib, OPV/IPV and hepatitis B at   six months; with live varicella zoster at 12 to 18 months; with MMR and Hib at   12 to 15 months; with DPT/DTaP, OPV/IPV at 18 months; and with DPT/DTaP, MMR,   OPV/IPV between four and six years for a total of 33 doses of 10 different viral   and bacterial vaccines by the age of five. National vaccination rates for   children under age three have climbed from between 60 to 80 percent in 1967 for   DPT, polio and measles vaccine to 90 percent in 1999 for DPT, polio, MMR, and   Hib vaccines. Vaccine coverage rates with core vaccines for five-year-old   children entering kindergarten have reached 98 percent plus in many   states.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccination today is not just a medical   intervention afforded by the rich and taken advantage of by the well educated   but an equal opportunity extended to the rich and poor, the educated and   uneducated alike, and enforced in the U.S. by state mandates. Although cases of   autism in the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s were concentrated in the upper and upper middle   classes, today the growing numbers of children affected with autism come from   all social classes.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Encephalitis:&nbsp; From Disease and   Vaccines</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis,   encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy) has been documented for more than 200 years   in the medical literature to be caused by viral and bacterial infections as well   as the vaccines containing altered viruses and bacteria. Smallpox infection can   involve brain inflammation with symptoms ranging from fever, vomiting,   drowsiness, and convulsions which progress over a period of one to four weeks,   sometimes ending in coma and death.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaccinia virus used by Edward Jenner in 1796 to   prevent smallpox was found to cause acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)   within one to six weeks of smallpox vaccination estimated to occur in 1 in 5,000   persons. Smallpox vaccination has also been reported to cause a slow, subacute   persistent viral infection that can emerge years after vaccination (Adams et al,   1972) and end in death. (The myelin sheath that encloses many nerve fibers helps   the transmission of neural impulses and if the myelin sheath is damaged through   traumatic injury, metabolic disorders, toxic insult, viral or bacterial   infection or vaccination, it can cause degeneration or   demyelination).</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Pasteur&rsquo;s Rabies Vaccine</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabies, a viral disease of the central nervous   system (CNS), can take 10 days to a year for the virus to reach the brain but,   once it does, encephalomyelitis symptoms include excessive motor activity,   excitation, agitation, confusion, combativeness, bizarre aberrations of thought,   seizures and other CNS dysfunction. After Pasteur began to inject patients with   rabies vaccine in the 1880&rsquo;s, it became obvious that brain inflammation was a   side effect. Encephalitis and polyneuritis has been estimated to occur in as   many as 1 in 400 vaccinated individuals, with Hemachudha, Griffin, et al in 1987   presenting evidence for an immune-mediated mechanism involving antibodies to   myelin basic protein.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Measles and EEG, Behavior Changes</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three weeks of even a mild measles   infection, one in 1,000 cases can develop encephalomyelitis with signs including   fever, headache and drowsiness. Residual brain damage from measles encephalitis   ranges from mental and behavior changes, including subtle changes in   performance, to seizure disorders and mental retardation. Changes in the   electroencephalogram (EEG) have been demonstrated in half of those who have had   measles but do not show other signs of CNS dysfunction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Measles virus infection has long been known to be   associated with demyelinating disorders. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) has been   reported following measles disease (Lidin-Janson, 1972) and after measles   vaccination (Grose and Spigland, 1976). Optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis in   children has also been reported after measles disease and measles vaccination   (Riikonen, 1989). In 1973, Landrigan and Witte described 45 cases of   encephalitis occurring between 6 and 15 days following measles   vaccination.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Persistent Measles Virus Infection</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a   rare subacute encephalitis complication of measles infection which causes slow   demyelination of the brain over a one to two year period and ends in death. It   has also been reported after measles vaccination (Schneck, 1968). In 1994, the   Institute of Medicine concluded that the live measles virus vaccine can cause   death from measles vaccine strain viral infection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, officials of the National Vaccine Injury   Compensation Program, Public Health Service (Pediatrics; March 1998) found that   a causal relationship exists between live measles vaccine and encephalopathy   after analyzing cases of children who received measles vaccine alone or in the   combination MMR shot and, within 15 days of vaccination, suffered neurologic   signs that progressed to death or mental regression, retardation, chronic   seizures, motor and sensory deficits and movement disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Brazil has   been linked to the MMR vaccine (Am J Epidmiol, 2000). A research team found   there was a sharp increase in the number of cases of aseptic meningitis three   weeks after a 1997 mass MMR vaccination campaign in northeastern Brazil. The   researchers &quot;conservatively estimated&quot; that the risk of aseptic meningitis is 1   in about 14,000 MMR vaccine doses. (A type of brain inflammation involving the   meninges, aseptic meningitis can be caused by viruses and bacteria as well as   stroke, lead poisoning, and vaccine reactions (Berkow, 1987). Most people   recover from aseptic meningitis without damage but some are left with muscle   weakness or other motor dysfunction).</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Mumps, Rubella and Brain Inflammation</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumps has been known to cause meningitis and   encephalitis since the eighteenth century. Russell and Donald, observed in 1958   that &quot;the clinical resemblance between mumps</p>\r\n<p>encephalitis and the encephalitis which may follow   measles, varicella and rubella, and the fact that the histological appearance of   perivascular demyelination are common to them all, suggest that they arise from   the same pathological process. The nature of this process is unknown, but it may   be a non-specific allergic reaction to virus protein (Miller and Evans, 1953)   and similar lesions have been produced experimentally by the injection of brain   material with adjuvants (Lumsden, 1949).&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many case reports and studies   documenting meningitis within three weeks of mumps vaccination (Brown, 1991),   and after MMR vaccination (Sugiura and Yamada, 1991), primarily with the Urabe   vaccine strain virus. There have also been reports of meningitis after   vaccination with the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine strain (Ehrengut and Zastrow,   1989) now used in MMR vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubella disease is caused by an RNA virus and,   although mild in children, it can be transmitted from mother to fetus in utero   and cause enchephalitis and devastating harm to the unborn child, including   mental retardation, hearing and vision loss, heart and neuromuscular deformity.   In the rubella epidemic that swept the U.S. in 1964, an estimated 20,000 to   30,000 children whose pregnant mothers were infected with rubella were born   severely damaged and a high rate of classic and &quot;partial&quot; autism was observed in   those children by Chess in 1971. In 1977, Chess reported that the rate of autism   in children born with congenital rubella from the 1964 epidemic was equivalent   to a rate of &quot;412 per 10,000 for the complete syndrome of autism and 329 for the   partial syndrome, giving a combined rate of 741 per 10,000&quot; compared to the rate   of autism in children without congenital rubella syndrome (estimated in 1966 to   be 2.1 cases of autism per 10,000 children (Lotter, 1966).</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Encephalitis and Mild Brain Damage</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1920&rsquo;s, when a mini-epidemic of &quot;von   Economo&rsquo;s encephalitis&quot; swept through Europe and America, doctors found that   some of those who recovered were left with minimal brain damage including   changes in behavior, restlessness, insomnia or disturbed sleep patterns,   irritability, short attention span, emotional disorders and seizures. In 1934,   Kahn and Cohen described a group of children with the inability to sit still or   concentrate, which they attributed to exposure to von Economo&rsquo;s   encephalitis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese encephalitis can cause permanent CNS   changes including personality and behavior problems featuring emotional lability   and irritability, speech disorders, hemiplegia, mental retardation and seizures.   Chicken pox and mumps infections can, in rare cases, progress to encephalitis   and brain inflammation has also been reported to follow chicken pox and mumps   vaccines.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Polio and CNS Damage</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Poliomyelitis is caused by an enterovirus in which   one to two percent of infected individuals develop disease in the central   nervous system, and fewer go on to have residual paralysis or die. Likewise,   within one to six months of receiving the live attenuated polio vaccine,   complications can occur which, according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in   1994, can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome as well as vaccine strain viral   infection ending in paralysis and death. In both cases, the polio virus invades   the CNS and destroys neurons. (Since 1979, the only cases of paralytic polio   which have occurred in the US have been caused by the live oral polio vaccine   (OPV) and it is no longer recommended by the CDC or AAP, having been replaced by   the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) which cannot cause polio in the person   vaccinated or a person who comes into contact with that person&rsquo;s body   fluids).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bacteria Also Cause Brain Inflammation</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But brain   inflammation is not only caused by viruses and viral vaccines. Bacterial   infections and bacterial vaccines also can cause brain inflammation ending in   permanent CNS damage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Encephalitis has always been the most dreaded   complication of pertussis or whooping cough, with endotoxin and pertussis toxin   in the B. pertussis bacteria responsible for most of it. Pertussis toxin is one   of the most lethal toxins in nature and can cross the blood brain barrier when   conditions are right. It has long been known that a severe case of whooping   cough accompanied by brain inflammation symptoms such as fever, lethargy,   vomiting and seizures can be fatal or cause permanent brain damage ranging from   seizure disorders and mental retardation to learning, personality and behavioral   disorders (Lurie &amp; Levy, 1942).</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Pertussis Toxin Lethal</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1950&rsquo;s, scientists conducting experiments   have added pertussis toxin to a solution of nerve tissue and injected it into   sensitized mice to deliberately induce brain inflammation. However pertussis   toxin is also thought to be involved in acquiring immunity to the disease, both   after natural infection and after vaccination (Pittman, 1979).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccine developers continue to have a problem   making a pertussis vaccine that contains pertussis toxin inactivated enough to   be safe but active enough to be immunogenic, which is why the purified DTaP   vaccine is associated with the same CNS complications as the whole cell DPT   vaccine, although they are reported to occur at a much lower rate with DTaP.   (The more reactive whole cell DPT vaccine has not been taken off the market and   it is still being used by some pediatricians, especially in the combination DPTH   (DPT plus Hib). Parents who want the purified DTaP for their children must ask   for it by name.)</p>\r\n<p>DPT Vaccine Causes Brain Inflammation</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1947, the first reports of brain inflammation   and chronic brain damage, including death, after pertussis vaccination were   published (Brody, 1947; Byers and Moll, 1948). In 1955, Niels Low showed that   the EEG (electroencephalogram) of infants sometimes was altered by the DPT shot.   He concluded that &quot;mild, but possibly significant, cerebral reactions occur in   addition to the reported very severe neurological changes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1982, numerous reports of CNS dysfunction   following DPT vaccination had appeared in the medical literature (Berg, 1958;   Strom, 1960, 1967; Dick, 1967, 1974; Kuhlenkampff, 1974; Stewart, 1977, 1979).   In 1981, Pediatrics published a UCLA/FDA study by Cody et al revealing that 1 in   875 DPT shots in the U.S. is followed by a convulsion or collapse/shock   reaction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after more than 40 years of evidence in   the medical literature that the DPT vaccine was causing brain inflammation and   CNS damage in previously healthy children, this fact was confirmed by medical   science in the 1981 National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) and in 1991   and 1994 by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences   (IOM).</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Brain Damage On A Continuum</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of brain inflammation within seven days of   DPT vaccination can range from high fever, irritability, high pitched screaming,   prolonged crying for hours, drowsiness, and vomiting to seizures, collapse and   unresponsiveness (altered state of consciousness) followed by immediate frank   regression or progressive changes in mental, emotional and physical health   ending with a diagnosis of mental retardation, seizure disorders, learning   disabilities and other chronic neurological damage. DPT vaccine-induced brain   inflammation, the IOM noted in 1994, is associated with a &quot;broad range of long   term dysfunctions (neurological, behavioral, educational, motor, sensory, and   self care dysfunctions)&quot; that are similar to those experienced by children after   serious acute neurologic illnesses due to other causes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; [A child, who had been healthy and bright before he   reacted within four hours of his DPT shot at 19 months of age with a convulsion   followed by days of fever and screaming and was left mentally retarded with   autistic behaviors, was awarded compensation in 1996 under the National   Childhood Vaccine Injury Act despite protests by federal health officials that   he was autistic and there is no proof that DPT vaccine causes autism. The U.S.   Court of Claims made the award, agreeing with the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer that   autistic behaviors can be the result of brain injury, including brain injury   caused by DPT vaccine.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Shot in the Dark</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the   sources of information reviewed by the IOM and included in references in their   1991 report on pertusiss vaccine was original research documenting more than 100   case histories of DPT vaccine associated immune mediated neurological   dysfunction contained in Coulter and Fisher&rsquo;s DPT: A Shot in the Dark (Harcourt   Brace Jovanovich, 1985; Warner, 1986; Avery, 1991). Their book was the first to   undertake an extensive examination of the history of pertussis and the pertussis   vaccine within the larger context of the medical, scientific, legal, social, and   political issues involving mass vaccination policies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In their book, Coulter and Fisher described   numerous case reports in more than 50 years of medical literature and in new   case studies they presented of children, who had been developing normally (and   in many cases were of above average intelligence), and then received a DPT shot   (often simultaneously with live oral polio vaccine) who then exhibited symptoms   of brain inflammation, including high fever, extreme drowsiness, vomiting, high   pitched screaming, seizures, and alterations of consciousness. Many of these   children were subsequently diagnosed as mentally retarded, epileptic, learning   disabled, hyperactive, or autistic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a good number of cases, the children who had   reacted neurologically to DPT were allergic, particularly to milk, or had been   vaccinated while they were sick with a coinciding viral or bacterial infection.   In addition to neurological damage, many were also left with chronic   gastrointestinal dysfunction and severe allergies, as well as autoimmune   disorders such as asthma. The personal or family history of autoimmune disorders   appeared to outweigh a history of neurological disorders in terms of being a   high risk factor for reacting to DPT, although a history of convulsions in the   family was also a high risk factor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tetanus, Hib Affects The Brain</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tetanus   bacillus produces one of the most potent toxins in nature which can severely   damage the brain. In 1991, the Institute of Medicine concluded that tetanus   vaccine can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which begins one to four weeks   after vaccination and takes up to four weeks to progress. The tetanus vaccine   was also found to cause brachial neuritis, a neuropathy that usually appears   within three weeks of vaccination involving painful nerve inflammation in the   arm and shoulder which can progress over a period of many months.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hib disease, a type of bacterial meningitis, is   known to have a direct effect on the CNS and can involve seizures and profound   brain damage. Although reports of demyelination (transverse myelitis and GBS)   have been reported after children receive Hib (haemophilus influenza B) vaccine,   which contains the Hib organism&rsquo;s capsular polysaccharide, a causal relationship   has not yet been confirmed. The combination DPTH vaccine has been given to   children since 1988.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Autoimmunity: From Disease and   Vaccines</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1935,   scientists investigating the neurological complications of rabies vaccine   discovered they could deliberately induce brain inflammation in lab animals by   injecting them with brain myelin, causing an autoimmune reaction whereby the   animal develops antibodies to its own brain tissue, causing demyelination.   (Rivers &amp; Schwenker, 1935).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The autoimmune diseases diabetes, multiple   sclerosis, and lupus, for example, involve chronic inflammation that causes   tissue destruction including central nervous system damage. It is thought that   these diseases may be triggered by an infection that activates autoreactive   T-cells and, in individuals genetically susceptible to developing autoimmunity,   results in chronic inflammation and/or autoantibodies that selectively destroy   organs in the body such as the brain.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Hepatitis B and Autoimmunity</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past decade, there have been persistent   reports in the medical literature that, within weeks of recombinant hepatitis B   vaccination, some children and adults are suffering recurring fevers, severe   joint pain, vision and memory loss, muscle weakness, debilitating fatigue and   other chronic immune and neurological dysfunction which can involve   demyelination of the brain. The virus that causes hepatitis B disease attacks   the liver and can cause such severe joint pain, fatigue and weakness that the   disease is sometimes mistaken for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rare   complications of hepatitis B disease include demyelinating disease, such as   transverse myelitis, and neuropathy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, clinical symptoms that follow hepatitis B   vaccine complications are similar to lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as   optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis (Guiserix, 1996; Pope &amp; Bell, 1998;   WHO, 1990;Berkman, 1996). GBS, chronic fatigue and vascular disorders have also   been reported (Shaw, 1988; Salit, 1993; Granel, 1997). Tourbah et al described   CNS inflammation within 10 weeks of hepatitis B vaccination (Neurology, 1999)   and concluded that &quot;The persistent inflammatory activity observed clinically and   on MRI in these patients is comparable to that usually observed in multiple   sclerosis,&quot; hypothesizing a triggering role of hepatitis B vaccination in CNS   demyelination.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Burton Waisbren, M.D., began writing and speaking   about molecular mimicry and hepatitis B vaccine reactions in 1996. Bonnie   Dunbar, Ph.D., Professor of Cell Biology, Baylor<strong> </strong>College of Medicine;   Ronald Kennedy, Ph.D., Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, and William   Hildebrand, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, of the University of Oklahoma Health   Sciences Center are three scientists working to clarify the role that genetic   predisposition may play in the development of immune mediated neurological   dysfunction following hepatitis B vaccination.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;They are studying families with several members who   have reacted severely to hepatitis B vaccine and are investigating autoimmune   mechanisms involving molecular mimicry and epitope spreading. Dr. Hildebrand   made a presentation at the October 26-27, 1998 Institute of Medicine Vaccine   Safety Forum Workshop on the correlation between major histocompatibility   complex (MHC) genes and autoimmune diseases.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunbar, an award winning vaccine developer, whose   brother suffered a severe, disabling reaction to several hepatitis B   vaccinations, is particularly concerned that race may be a factor in both normal   and abnormal immune responses to vaccines. She said, &quot;There may be variations in   the way that different genetic populations respond to different vaccines and   this needs to be carefully evaluated before new vaccines are licensed and   recommended for use by everyone.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis B vaccine has also been associated with   diabetes (Poutasi, 1996). A 1996 report by Barthelow Classen, M.D. in the New   Zealand Medical Journal noted a 60 percent increase in juvenile diabetes   following a massive hepatitis B vaccine campaign for babies from 1988 to 1991.   In 1997, U.S. federal health officials acknowledged that one of their own   studies showed that &quot;the possibility that hepatitis B vaccination, particularly   at older ages, may increase insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) risk   cannot be ruled out and will require larger more detailed studies.&quot;(Classen has   also published studies which show an increase in diabetes in children after the   addition of Hib and MMR vaccine in Finland (Infectious Diseases in Clinical   Practice, 1997).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pertussis, DPT and Autoimmunity</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pertussis   toxin, sometimes referred to as islet-activating protein, has been shown in   laboratory animals to provoke excess production of insulin by the pancreas and   diabetes in mice. In 1970, Pittman talked about DPT &quot;vaccine-induced   hypoglycemia&quot; and a report in 1982 (Champsaur et al, Journal of Pediatrics)   concluded that the administration of the DPT vaccine to a 16 month old child   with a coinciding viral infection and a genetic predisposition may have lead to   &quot;insular damage and anti-islet autoimmune reactions, leading to   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earliest days of pertussis vaccine use, it   has been associated with development of asthma in previously healthy children   (Koeng, 1953; Halpern &amp; Halpern, 1955; Hopper, 1961; Hannik, 1969). In a   1997 issue of Epidemiology, New Zealand researchers reported that of 1,265 New   Zealanders born in 1977, 23 received no childhood vaccinations and none suffered   childhood asthma. Among the 1,242 who got DPT and polio shots, 23 percent later   had episodes of asthma, 23 percent had asthma consultations and 30 percent had   consultations for other allergic illness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent study (Hurwitz &amp; Morgenstern, 2000)   reviewing data from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1988 to 1994   and, comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated children, it was found that a child   who received DPT or tetanus vaccination was 50 percent more likely to experience   severe allergic reactions, more than 80 percent more likely to experience   sinusitis and twice as likely to experience asthma as those children who were   not vaccinated. The authors concluded that &quot;asthma and other allergic   hypersensitivity reactions and related symptoms may be caused, in part, by the   delayed effects of DTP or tetanus vaccination.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Rubella and Autoimmunity</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary complications of rubella disease and   live rubella vaccine are autoimmune. There is evidence that persistent rubella   viral infection in congenital rubella victims can cause diabetes (Menser, 1978;   Rubenstein et al, 1982). And chronic arthritis has been confirmed to be caused   by both the disease and vaccine. In 1991, the Institute of Medicine found a   causal relationship between rubella vaccine (RA 27/3) and the development of   acute and chronic arthritis. Symptoms of severe joint pain most often occur   within two to three weeks of vaccination, which has been noted to be the   incubation period of natural rubella and the time period in which the vaccine   strain virus can be isolated.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Mumps, Measles, MMR and Autoimmunity</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 1800&rsquo;s, the development of Insulin   Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) after mumps infection has been persistently   reported (Harris, 1899; Otten et al, 1984). There also have been case reports of   diabetes following mumps vaccination (Sinaniotis, 1975; Otten, 1984) and after   measles-mumps vaccination (Quast, 1979) and MMR vaccination (Taranger,   1987).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A gastrointestinal disorder thought to be caused by   infectious or immune mechanisms is Crohn&rsquo;s disease, which has been linked to   measles infection (Ekbom, 1994) and measles vaccine (Thompson, 1995). Crohn&rsquo;s   disease and ulcerative colitis, both thought to be autoimmune disorders, have   also been reported to occur at a high rate in persons who had measles and mumps   infections in the same year of life (Montgomery et al, 1999). Evidence has been   documented that measles infection as well as the MMR vaccine may be involved in   the development of a syndrome involving both inflammatory bowel disease and   regressive developmental disorder in children (Wakefield et al,   1998).</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Autism, The Brain, and The Immune System</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, the controversial hypothesis that   autism is somehow linked with vaccination has set the stage for a long overdue   examination of the interaction between the brain and the immune system and the   evidence for both disease and vaccine-induced immune and brain dysfunction,   which has been documented in the medical literature for more than 200   years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rimland in the 1960&rsquo;s persuaded researchers   to investigate the biological rather than psychological cause for autism, DeMyer   and her colleagues wrote in a 1973 Journal of Autism and Childhood Schizophrenia   that the findings of their study &quot;in conjunction with other investigations,   support the biological cause theory of autism.&quot; The authors noted that a high   number of autistic children have &quot;gross EEG abnormalities&quot; and are   neurologically handicapped with learning and behavior disorders that range from   mild to severe mental retardation. They concluded that &quot;viral disease during or   after gestation, birth trauma, malnutrition, oxygen lack or generally any of the   events known to damage the brain may be the cause of the autistic   syndrome.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Seizures and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, Mnukhin and Isaev also found a high   incidence of epileptic seizures in autistic children, indicating autism has an   organic, neurological basis. They were soon joined by other autism researchers   who asserted that the symptoms of autism are grounded in dysfunction of the   nervous system (Ornitz &amp; Ritvo, 1976).&nbsp;Deykin and MacMahon in 1979 (American   Journal of Epidemiology) agreed that the high rate of abnormal EEG&rsquo;s and   seizures in autistic children suggested neurologic damage. They pointed out that   the central nervous system is not fully developed at birth and may be at special   risk for brain damage from viral infections in the first year of life. They   concluded that &quot;viruses with encephalitic potential, especially those occurring   during gestation or during the first few months of life might be associated with   the development of certain childhood mental illnesses.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Autoimmunity Affects Vaccine Responses</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, Weizman and his colleagues reported   that some autistics have abnormal cell-mediated immune responses to myelin basic   protein, (a component of brain myelin) suggesting that an autoimmune mechanism   may be involved in the development of autism. That report reinforced   observations by Stubbs in 1976 that some autistic children have defective   antibody responses to rubella vaccine and, in 1977, that autistic children have   depressed T-cell responses.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1984 in Pediatric Annals, Ritvo and Freeman   described the medical model of autism and concluded, &quot;The symptoms are due to   neuropathology which, in turn, may have a variety of etiologies,&quot; observing that   there is a high rate of abnormal EEG&rsquo;s, seizures, severe allergies, and   significant differences in brain metabolism patterns and brain chemistry in   autistic children compared to those who are not autistic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The autoimmune connection was made again by Reed   Warren and his associates in 1986 when they presented evidence that confirmed   Stubb&rsquo;s studies in the 1970&rsquo;s indicating that autism is associated with immune   system dysfunction. Warren stated, &quot;The lack of suppressor cells in the autistic   patients may be consistent with an autoimmune process underlying the development   of autism.&quot; He added, &quot;Our findings in the autistic patients are quite similar   to those observed in a study of patients hospitalized for major depressive   disorder.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, Rutter and Schopler writing in Journal of   Autism and Developmental Disorders, discussed the clear differences between   adult schizophrenia and childhood autism, particularly the high rate of seizures   and mental retardation in autistic children. They pointed out that there were   two groups of autistic children: those babies who have abnormal behavior at   birth and those who develop normally and then regress and added &quot;There is no one   basic deficit because the disorder reflects varying patterns of organic brain   dysfunction rather than any single disease state.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>IOM Weighs In</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1991, when the Institute of Medicine published   Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines confirming that pertussis and   rubella vaccines can cause brain and immune system damage, there were increasing   numbers of parents reporting that their previously normal children were   regressing into autism after DPT or MMR vaccination. However, the IOM physician   committee charged with analyzing the medical literature for evidence of cause   and effect rejected the reported link between pertussis vaccine and autism based   on the fact that in the medical literature &quot;no data were identified that address   the question of a relation between vaccination with DPT or its pertussis   component and autism.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of evidence in the medical literature   directly connecting autism to vaccination is not surprising given the forty year   debate in autism research about whether the disorder was psychiatric or   biologically based. The question of whether rubella vaccine could be causally   linked to development of autism was not discussed in the 1991 IOM report. The   subsequent 1994 IOM report, Adverse Events Associated with Childhood Vaccines,   also did not address the question of whether there was biological plausibility   that any of the components of MMR vaccine or other vaccines could cause   autism.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>A Mom Cures Her Son</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a California Mom whose first-born, a son   named Garrett, was a happy, healthy and bright toddler until he got his MMR   vaccination in 1990 when he was 13 months old and, within two weeks, began   exhibiting autistic behavior. &quot;It was so gradual,&quot; said Cindy Goldenberg, &quot;I   barely noticed it. He began to avoid eye contact. He lost language skills. He   didn&rsquo;t see or respond to us and would only line up the toys in front of   him.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At age 18 months, Garrett got a haemophilus   influenzae B (Hib) vaccination and his autistic symptoms worsened. &quot;He started   flapping his arms, twirling and spinning. Noise terrified him. He stopped   talking. He gagged on his food. He exhibited autistic, compulsive and   hyperactive behaviors.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy took Garrett to doctors specializing in   learning disabilities, psychology, hearing and speech disorders, desperately   trying to find an answer to why her little boy had changed so dramatically.   Cindy was convinced Garrett&rsquo;s symptoms were connected to a biological cause and   finally found a pediatrician who performed diagnostic testing, including blood   tests.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;All tests came back negative except for one &ndash; a   blood test showing Garrett had a borderline high rubella titer. Cindy wondered   why Garrett&rsquo;s rubella titer would be above normal a year after getting   vaccinated. That one clue prompted Cindy to delve into the medical literature on   autism, rubella, vaccines and the immune system. What she found convinced her   that, just as rubella infection can cause autistic behaviors in children with   congenital rubella, so could the live rubella vaccine in the MMR shot cause   autistic behaviors. She also suspected that because vaccines were injected   directly into the bloodstream, they were capable of interfering with the body&rsquo;s   primary immune system, affecting the immunoglobulin (IgG) levels that facilitate   the absorption of nutrients by the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal   system.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Autism Ends With Lower Rubella Titers</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding fast to her conviction that the MMR vaccine   had caused her son&rsquo;s autistic behaviors and that intravenous immune globulin   intravenous infusions (IGIV) could help boost his IgG levels, heal his primary   immune system and lead to reduced autistic symptoms, she contacted Sudhir Gupta,   M.D., Ph.D., University of California professor of medicine and immunology for   help. Gupta confirmed that Garrett had elevated rubella titers as well as very   low IgA and low levels of IgG subclasses. After discussing options with Cindy,   Dr. Gupta agreed to give Garrett IGIV infusions which, because of the known   interaction between the immune and neurological system, might have a restorative   effect on his immune and brain dysfunction. (IGIV therapy has been given to   patients with immunoinflammatory disorders, including demyelinating multiple   sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, with the same hope and has been   successful in some patients).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Cindy changed Garrett&rsquo;s diet,   limiting milk and wheat, and gave him vitamin and nutritional supplements such   as acidophilus and globulin protein from whey to enhance the optimal functioning   of his immune and gastrointestinal system. Within weeks of the IGIV and   nutritional supplement therapy, Cindy saw dramatic improvement in her son&rsquo;s   behavior. As Garrett&rsquo;s rubella titer levels came down and his IgG and IgA levels   stabilized, Garrett became less and less autistic. He was eventually weaned off   the IGIV but Cindy continued to give him globulin protein from whey.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By age four, gone were the repetitive behaviors and   refusal to make eye contact or speak. Cindy also worked round-the-clock using   behavioral, sensory integrative, speech and auditory training therapies to help   Garrett &quot;catch-up&quot; to his peers in development. Today, Garrett is in a regular   classroom in the public school system getting A&rsquo;s, playing in sports and looking   forward to junior high when he can &quot;date girls.&quot; Cindy, who spoke out in the   mid-1990&rsquo;s in the print and broadcast media about the role of vaccination in   Garrett&rsquo;s autism and how he was cured, gave new hope to a generation of parents   of autistic children who had been told there was no cause or cure for   autism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, Dr. Gupta published a study on the   beneficial effects of IGIV in children with autistic behaviors who have immune   deficiency.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Maternal Antibodies and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Two reports in 1999 by F. Edward Yazbak,   M.D., investigated the possibility that mothers may transfer maternal antibodies   to rubella either transplacentally or through breast milk to their babies and,   when the babies are vaccinated with MMR, some develop an autoimmune reaction   with pre-existing rubella antigen that leads to autistic   behaviors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yazbak evaluated the rubella or MMR vaccination   history of 240 mothers of autistic children. He described cases of mothers   re-vaccinated with rubella or MMR vaccine in adulthood before, during or after   pregnancy whose children became autistic after MMR vaccination. Many of these   mothers breast-fed their babies. Publication of the complete data is   pending.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Brain Autoantibodies and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, Vijendra Singh and associates published a   study in which 58 percent of autistic children tested positive for   auto-antibodies to myelin basic protein compared to 9 percent of age-matched   controls with normal health, idiopathic mental retardation, Down syndrome and   normal adults of 20 to 40 years of age. They concluded &quot;it is possible that   autoimmunity may explain a subset of autism&quot; and hypothesized that &quot;if an   immunological assault perhaps secondary to a virus infection were to occur   prenatally or postnatally during infancy or early childhood, it could possibly   result in poor myelination or abnormal function of the neuro-axon   myelin.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Singh and his colleagues presented further   evidence that a virus-induced autoimmune response involving autoantibodies to   myelin basic protein (MBP) is linked to some cases of autism. Published in   Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology, their study compared autistic children   to normal controls and found that, although both normal and autistic children   had antibodies to measles and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), many of the autistic   children had auto-antibodies to MBP and auto-antibodies to neuron-axon filament   protein while none of the normal controls did. (Neuron-axon filament protein is   a component of nerve fibers).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the antibody titers to measles and HHV-6   in the autistic children, the greater the likelihood that the autistic children   also showed brain autoantibodies. The strongest link found in the autistic   children was between measles virus antibodies and antibodies to myelin basic   protein (MBP). The study results suggest that in some individuals exposure to   the measles virus may trigger an autoimmune response that damages or interferes   with the development of myelin.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Singh and his colleagues observed that &quot;although   there is no research data, parents of autistic children quite commonly report   onset of the disorder shortly after immunization with MMR or DPT&quot; and concluded   that &quot;it is quite possible that measles infection is an earlier event in   autoimmunity to myelin (MBP) whereas HHV-6 infection may exist as a co-infection   or reactivation mechanism.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Measles, MMR, The Gut and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the mounting scientific evidence that   viral and bacterial infections and the vaccines used to prevent them are capable   of producing a wide range of immune and neurological dysfunction, it is somewhat   strange from a scientific (although not a political) standpoint that a young   British gastroenterologist would have been subjected to personal attacks by the   medical community when he and 13 colleagues at Royal Free Hospital in London   presented evidence in 1998 (The Lancet, Feb. 27, http://www.thelancet.com) that   measles infection and measles vaccine may be linked to the development of   inflammatory bowel disease and autism in previously healthy, normally developing   children.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Wakefield, M.D. and his team had   inadvertently stumbled upon the connection while studying Crohn&rsquo;s disease and   other inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. The mother of one of   Wakefield&rsquo;s young patients, Rosemary Kessick, urged him to look for the   biological mechanism for simultaneous development of IBD and autistic behavior   in previously normal children. The Wakefield report reviewed the medical factors   common to eight out of 12 previously normal children who simultaneously   developed severe intestinal disorders and autistic behaviors. Previously, five   of those eight children had reacted adversely to vaccinations. All reported   onset of symptoms of IBD and autism after MMR vaccination.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In their discussion of the interaction between the   immune, nervous and gastrointestinal systems of the body, Wakefield and his   associates remarked that Asperger in 1961 had observed that there was a high   rate of gastrointestinal (celiac) disease in those suffering with autism. (In   1944, Asperger had identified a subgroup of high functioning &quot;borderline&quot;   autistics.) The authors hypothesized that persistent viral infection, either   from natural disease or live virus vaccines, can cause chronic inflammation of   the bowel and damage to the central nervous system development in some   children.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;They pointed to the &quot;opioid excess&quot; theory of   autism, first suggested by Panksepp in 1979 and then by Shattock (1991) and   Reichelt (1993) that autistic disorders result from the incomplete breakdown and   excessive absorption of gut-derived peptides from foods, including barley, rye,   oats and casein from milk and dairy products leading to disruption of normal   brain functioning and development. As these gut-derived peptides get into the   blood and cross the blood brain barrier, where they are not supposed to be, they   negatively affect the ability of the body to maintain appropriate endorphin,   serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Science Meets Politics</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The study authors emphasized that they had not   proved a cause and effect relationship and simply called for more studies to   explore the hypothesis. Their report was immediately met with charges by CDC   officials that &quot;vaccine safety concerns such as that reported by Wakefield and   colleagues may snowball&quot; when the public and the media &quot;confuse association with   causality and shun immunization.&quot; A Reuters newswire story quoted Neal Halsey,   M.D., of John&rsquo;s Hopkins and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics   Committee on Infectious Diseases, as saying it was &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; for   Wakefield and his colleagues to discuss a possible connection between the   children&rsquo;s health problems and measles or MMR vaccines. British government   health officials were also displeased and, in 1999, published a small   retrospective cases series analysis (Taylor et al, The Lancet) that they said   proved MMR vaccine is not associated with regressive autism but British and U.S.   parent groups and independent physicians have criticized the study as   methodologically flawed. (http://www.909shot/autismto.htm)</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Digging In and Speaking Out</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Wakefield and his associates have pressed   on, continuing research into several hundred cases of normal children who   suddenly develop gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression. At the   First International Public Conference on Vaccination sponsored by the National   Vaccine Information Center in September, 1997, Wakefield spoke about his   concerns that most of the original studies in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s evaluating   the safety of live measles and MMR vaccines only included a three week   follow-up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the Second International Autism Conference   sponsored by Allergy in Autism (AIA) in London in March, 1999, Wakefield   commented that children with a pre-existing immune abnormality may be   predisposed to sequestering the measles virus in the gut and the MMR vaccine   prompts them to develop autoimmunity leading to immune mediated CNS damage. One   of the most compelling regressive autism cases he had recently reviewed in his   practice was reminiscent of the days when autism was thought to be &quot;early-onset&quot;   schizophrenia: it was that of a normal, healthy 14 year old boy who got an MMR   shot and, within one week, developed bizarre behavior that was diagnosed as   schizophrenia.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Autoimmunity Family History and Autism</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between autism and autoimmunity was   further strengthened when a study published in the Journal of Child Neurology in   1999 (Comi et al) found a statistically significant correlation between a family   history of autoimmune disorders and autism. When comparing the medical histories   of families of 61 autistic patients and 46 healthy controls, the authors   discovered &quot;that the subjects who reported two or more family members with   autoimmune disorders were twice as likely to have autism, those with at least   three family members with autoimmune disorders were 5.5 times more likely to   have autism, and those whose mothers had autoimmune disorders were 8.8 times   more likely to be affected.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comi and her associates added, &quot;the percentage of   family members with adult rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, and the category   of connective tissue autoimmune disorders were greater in the autism group than   in controls and approached statistical significance in these cases.&quot; They   suggested that perhaps &quot;individuals with autism inherit a genetic predisposition   for autoimmunity that, in conjunction with medical triggers or other   environmental factors, results in developmental and neurologic   pathology.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>The Cells, Molecules and Genes Don&rsquo;t   Lie</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that some autoimmune disorders are   associated with genes of the major histocompatability complex (MHC). The MHC is   made up of hundreds of genes, some of which are involved in helping cells of the   immune system work together to resist infection and recognize the body&rsquo;s own   tissue. If these genes become damaged or abnormally rearranged from exposure to   viruses, bacteria or chemical toxins, they can cripple the body&rsquo;s defenses   against some infections or cause the immune system to mistakenly attack the   body&rsquo;s own tissues. For example, this is the genetic autoimmune mechanism   involved in diabetes when the immune system attacks cells in the   pancreas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, Reed Warren, Vijendra Singh and others   published a study in Clinical Experimental Immunology which found that a null   allele (deficient form) of the complement C4B gene, located in the class III   region of the MHC complex, occurred more than twice as often in autistic   individuals as in those who are normal. The products of the C4B and other   similar genes are critical to the activation of a mechanism that protects the   body against invading microorganisms.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a 1994 study, Warren and his colleagues   hypothesized that &quot;human subjects inheriting one or two C4B null alleles may not   be able to clear certain viruses completely before the viruses infect the   central nervous system. In 1995, they suggested that &quot;a total or partial C4B   deficiency contributes to the development of some cases of autism by allowing a   virus or bacterial infection to persist and eventually chronically activate   clones with reactivity to tissues of the CNS. Previous findings of immune   reactivity against myelin basic protein and the serotonin brain receptors in   autism are consistent with this hypothesis as well.&quot;</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Vaccines, The Gulf War and Genetic   Change</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, THE VACCINE REACTION reported that   California microbiologist Howard Urnovitz, Ph.D., criticized the Defense   Department for administering multiple vaccinations to soldiers heading for the   Gulf War, including cholera, live oral polio, typhoid fever, meningitis,   pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, yellow fever, recombinant hepatitis B, influenza   and two experimental vaccines, anthrax and botulinium, as well as an   experimental drug, pryridostigmine bromide. Urnovitz maintained that the   multiple vaccinations weakened the soldiers&rsquo; immune systems, making them more   vulnerable to environmental toxins and opportunistic infections encountered in   the Gulf War, causing tens of thousands to become chronically ill with &quot;Gulf War   Syndrome&quot; which includes symptoms such as chronic muscle and joint pain, rashes,   headache, disabling fatigue, memory loss, inability to concentrate, personality   changes, diarrhea, hair loss, and sleep disturbances.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Genotoxic Events and Chromosome Damage</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Urnovitz, who is also an expert on contamination of   polio vaccines with adventitious agents such as SV-40 (simian virus 40) and SIV   (simian immunodeficiency virus), published a study in 1999 in Clinical and   Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology that found abnormal RNA in the blood of 50   percent of sick Gulf War veterans and none in the age and sex matched healthy   non-military controls. The presence of abnormal RNA in the blood can indicate   that chromosomal change has occurred.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The RNA found in the sick Gulf War veterans is   encoded by genetic material that occurs only in regions of chromosome 22   (22q11.2), wch is uniquely susceptible to genetic rearrangements and mutations.   Damage to chromosome 22q11.2 has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as   juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, thrombocytopenia pupura and multiple myeloma   cancer. Urnovitz is especially concerned about the effect of &quot;genotoxic events&quot;   on the integrity of the human chromosome.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &quot;When the body is subjected to toxic   events such as exposure to viruses, bacteria, drugs, chemicals, or radiation,   there appears to be molecular memory. The human chromosome may be able to take   just so many toxic exposures before it begins to break down. Certain genotypes   may be particularly at risk for sustaining chromosomal damage after exposure to   toxic events. This makes it important to limit exposures, including being more   selective with vaccine use and finding ways to identify and pre-screen for those   who may be at high risk for chromosomal damage.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mercury Ordered Out of Vaccines</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of limiting   toxic exposures was advanced on July 7, 1999 when a joint statement was issued   by the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)   supporting the FDA&rsquo;s directive to the vaccine manufacturers to eliminate mercury   (in the form of Thimerosal, a preservative) from vaccines. Mercury is a known   neuro-toxin which can cross the placenta and blood brain barrier and concentrate   in the blood and brain but can also affect the immune system, kidneys and   lungs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;DPT, DPTH, tetanus, DT, Td, influenza,   meningococcal, and most DTaP, Hib and hepatitis B vaccines contain Thimerosal   (live virus vaccines do not). The total amount of mercury that babies under six   months old have been exposed to in childhood vaccines has exceeded the   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit. Both the AAP and CDC have   recommended that, to limit mercury exposure, newborns born to hepatitis B-free   mothers should not receive hepatitis B vaccine at birth unless it is   Thimerosal-free. There are thimerosal-free vaccines available but parents must   request them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aluminum is another additive in vaccines that is a   known neuro-toxin (Alfrey, 1976) and may increase the ability of toxins to cross   the blood-brain barrier (Banks &amp; Kastin, 1989). Other vaccine additives   include antibiotics, formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and sulfites   (http://www.cdc.gov/nip). Some autistic children have been found to have high   levels of mercury in their hair as well as heavy metals, such as aluminum and   lead, in their blood and have had detoxification therapy to cleanse the system   of these metals, which has led to significant improvements in behavior in some   children.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Therapies Target Immune System</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the understanding that regressive autism has   biological, particularly immunological, roots and that autistic behaviors   sometimes can be eliminated or modified through dietary or other immune   modulating therapies, innovative treatment programs are being explored by   doctors caring for autistic children. Doctors, who are members of Defeat Autism   Now! (DAN!), such as William Shaw, Ph.D., Sidney Baker, M.D., and Stephanie   Cave, M.D., have reduced autistic behaviors with individually tailored therapies   that may include limiting sugars, casein (dairy), wheat or other foods; using   anti-fungal drugs in children with suspected yeast overgrowth of the intestinal   tract; and employing nutritional supplements such as vitamin B-6, zinc, niacin,   vitamin C, calcium and folic acid to address metabolism and vitamin   deficiencies. Kelly Dorfman, M.S., L.N. and others have successfully devised   diet therapies to maximize immune and brain function.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia pediatrician Mary Megson, M.D. has treated   children injured by the DPT vaccine, who have a G-alpha protein defect, with   natural (cis) forms of Vitamin A. Secretin, a hormone derived from pig   intestines which stimulates the pancreas to produce gastric juices, has also   shown promise for reversing autistic behaviors in some children. Other doctors   are using neuro-imaging technology to measure blood flow to different parts of   the brain in order to tailor nutritional and drug therapies for children with   autism, specific learning disabilities, ADHD and other related   disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents have also reported improvement in health   and behavior with chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathic and naturopathic care.   Behavioral modification therapies, such as those pioneered by Ivar Lovaas, and   auditory, speech, vision and sensory integration therapy have also been very   important interventions for autistic children. What is clear to health   professionals using innovative therapies to treat autism is that each individual   is different and there are no guarantees.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Parents Organize</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents of old and young autistic children, who for   many years were given no hope that a cause and cure for autism could be   identified, are becoming proactive rather than resigned to living without hope.   In addition to the older established groups such as ASA and ARI, newer groups   such as F.E.A.T., Developmental Delay Resource founded by Patricia Lemer, Autism   Autoimmunity Project, Southwest Autism Research Institute, National Alliance for   Autism Research (NAAR) and Cure Autism Now (CAN) Foundation, headed by Portia   Iverson, are having an impact on the direction of autism research.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlocking Autism, co-founded by Louisiana Moms   Shelley Reynolds, whose son, Liam, developed autistic behaviors after   vaccination, and Jeana Smith, whose twin son has vaccine-associated autism, have   collected more than 3,500 photos of autistic children from around the country   for the &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; project. The photos were displayed on boards at the   &quot;Hear Their Silence&quot; Autism Awareness Rally held April 8, 2000 on the mall near   the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.. All of these groups, including the   National Vaccine Information Center, which has represented parents of children   with vaccine-associated autism for many years, are committed to working with   enlightened physicians to find the truth about the causes and cures for autism   and ways to prevent it from occurring.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Congress Looks At Vaccines</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 3, 1999 and April 6, 2000 the U.S. House   Government Reform Committee, chaired by Indiana Congressman Dan Burton, examined   vaccine safety issues, including vaccine-associated autism   (www.gov/reform/hearings/index.htm). Congressman Burton&rsquo;s two grandchildren   reacted to vaccines. Danielle Burton Sarkine&rsquo;s newborn daughter almost died   after a hepatitis B vaccination and her bright, healthy 14-month old son,   Christian, became autistic after being injected with 9 different vaccines on the   same day. The Government Reform Committee has also held a series of hearings on   the safety of the anthrax vaccine, while the subcommittee on criminal justice,   drug policy and human resources has examined hepatitis B vaccine safety   questions and the implementation of the compensation portion of the National   Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>NIH Meetings Focus on Research</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 14, 2000 a meeting took place at the   National Institutes of Health (NIH) with directors of four of the five NIH   health agencies and representatives of national parent organizations, whose   members have autistic children. NIH and parent groups discussed public and   private autism research efforts and needs, including ways to investigate whether   or not some children are genetically or otherwise biologically at risk for   suffering vaccine complications that could lead to immune and brain damage,   including autistic behaviors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 7, 2000 another meeting with parents and   NIH staff took place, which was also attended by Michael</p>\r\n<p>Goldberg, M.D., president of Neuroimmune Dysfunction   Syndrome Research Institute (NIDS) and Candace Pert, Ph.D., research professor   at Georgetown University School of Medicine. NVIC president Barbara Loe Fisher   called for a public-private collaborative research effort to fund basic science   research into the biological mechanisms of vaccine-induced autism as well as a   large prospective study which would measure biological changes (through blood   and urine tests, EEG&rsquo;s and brain scans, etc.) and monitor cognitive, physical   and behavior changes in a genetically diverse population of children as they are   being vaccinated in the first 10 years of life. In a subsequent letter to DHHS   Secretary Donna Shalala, Fisher, M.I.N.D. co-founder Rick Rollens and ARI   founder Bernard Rimland, Ph.D. called for non-governmental researchers with no   financial ties to vaccine manufacturers or the CDC to be involved in any   government-led investigation into causes for the national autism epidemic,   including the one in Brick Township, N.J.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Holds the Key</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the   prevention and cure of autism lies with the scientists and doctors with   integrity and vision inside and outside of government, who will conduct the kind   of basic science research into the interaction between vaccines, viral and   bacterial infections and other biological factors that contribute to development   of autism spectrum disorders. Without the will and funding commitment on the   part of Congress and federal health agencies that forges an equal and   collaborative partnership between government and independent researchers,   finding the truth will be left to parents and private foundations. <strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Private Research Begins</strong></p>\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, four California Dads with autistic   children &ndash; a general contractor, an investment advisor, a lobbyist and a   cardiologist &ndash; have pooled their talents and raised ten million dollars to   create the M.I.N.D. Institute (Medical Investigation of Neuro-developmental   Disorders) at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine and Medical   Center. (http://mindinstitute.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu). M.I.N.D. cofounder Rick   Rollens said the Institute &quot;is devoted to funding and conducting cutting edge   research into the biological basis for autism and other child developmental   disorders. Finding the causes of autism, ways to prevent it, and treatment   alternatives is a priority. We welcome grant applications from independent   researchers who have novel but well-grounded approaches to investigating all   possibilities, including the vaccine connection.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Neuroimmune Dysfunction Syndrome Research   Institute (NIDS) in California is investigating causes of brain and immune   system dysfunction and whether co-factors, such as vaccines, can trigger autism,   learning disabilities, ADHD, and chronic fatigue in some children. The Autism   Autoimmunity Project and Unlocking Autism have given grants to independent   researchers investigating vaccine-associated autism, as has the British parent   group, Allergy in Autism (AIA), founded by Rosemary Kessick and Meryl Nee, two   mothers of children with vaccine-associated autism. NVIC has created the   Children&rsquo;s Fund for Hope and Healing, which is devoted to raising seed money for   independent researchers investigating the biological mechanism of and biological   risk factors for vaccine-induced autism, arthritis, asthma, learning   disabilities, ADHD, diabetes, chronic fatigue and other brain and immune system   dysfunction. CAN and NAAR have funded general autism research not specifically   vaccine-related.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>What Can Be Done Today</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, the physician committee appointed by the   Institute of Medicine to examine the medical literature for evidence that   vaccines cause injury and death, stated, &quot;In the course of its review, the   committee encountered many gaps and limitations in knowledge bearing directly or   indirectly on the safety of vaccines. These include inadequate understanding of   the biologic mechanisms underlying adverse events following natural infection or   immunization, insufficient or inconsistent information from case reports and   case series, inadequate size or length of follow-up of many population based   epidemiologic studies [and] few experimental studies published in relation to   the number of epidemiologic studies published.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important action that can be taken today   by parents, doctors and public health officials, is to acknowledge the gaps in   knowledge about the way vaccines singly or in combination act on the developing   immune and neurological system and the role that viral and bacterial infections,   environmental toxins and genetics can play in the development of   vaccine-associated autism and other learning, behavior, and autoimmune   disorders. Doctors should be better educated in medical school about the   potential risks, as well as the benefits, of different vaccines so they can   become partners with parents in preventing vaccine-induced health   problems.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Doctors Should Report to VAERS</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors should be required to adhere to the law   requiring the reporting of serious health problems such as developmental   regression following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System   (VAERS), as it is estimated that only between one and 10 percent of all doctors   do report (even so, between 12,000 and 14,000 reports of adverse events,   including hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following vaccination are made   annually). Parents, whose children suffer injury or death following vaccination,   should be fully informed by their pediatricians about the existence of the   federal vaccine injury compensation program, which has awarded more than one   billion dollars to families whose children have died or been injured after   vaccine reactions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal safety standards for licensing and making   policy for new vaccines, particularly combination vaccines, should be   re-examined. Vaccine policies must be tailored to the individual and steps taken   to minimize vaccine risks such as limiting simultaneous administration of   vaccines; screening out children who are sick at the time of vaccination;   re-evaluating the benefits and risks of re-vaccinating adult women with rubella   or MMR; and carefully monitoring children following vaccination for signs of   developmental regression so that re-vaccination does not take   place.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p>Informed Consent to Vaccination</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed consent protections must be inserted in   vaccination laws, widening medical exemptions and strengthening religious and   conscientious belief exemptions, and laws implemented in a more humane way.   Parents, who believe their children are at high risk of developing immune or   brain system problems following vaccination, must be allowed to make informed,   voluntary vaccination decisions for their children without facing economic,   educational or other sanctions for trying to protect their children from   harm.</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/vaccines-and-diseases/Autism/specialreport.aspx\">Bibliography   Available</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bibliography containing more than 125 references   supporting information contained in this special report may be viewed on the   NVIC website at http://www.nvic.org.</p>\r\n<p>Additional Resources:</p>\r\n<p>Selected Books:</p>\r\n<p>A Shot in the Dark (Coulter &amp; Fisher, Avery), The   Consumer&rsquo;s Guide to Childhood Vaccines (Fisher, NVIC) and Vaccination, Social   Violence and Criminality (Coulter, North Atlantic Books) are available through   NVIC.</p>\r\n<p>Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines   (IOM); Adverse Effects of Childhood Vaccines (IOM); DPT Vaccine and Chronic   Nervous System Dysfunction: A New Analysis are available for order through the   Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences by calling   1-800-624-6242.</p>\r\n<p>For exploring treatment options for autistic   children, Unraveling the Mysteries of Autism and P.D.D. by Karyn Seroussi (Simon   &amp; Schuster); Biological Treatments for Autism by William Shaw; and Special   Diets for Special Children by Lisa Lewis are available through:   http://www.nvic.org Click on the NVIC Marketplace button and order through   Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble.</p>\r\n<p>Selected Press Articles:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>&nbsp;State Reports an Epidemic of Autistic Children by   Thomas H.

NVIC promotes   scientific research into the biological causes of vaccine injury and death in   order to identify factors which place individuals at high risk for suffering   vaccine reactions and advocates the institution of informed consent protections   within the mass vaccination system, as well as oversight mechanisms to more   effectively monitor the vaccine research, development, regulation and promotion   activities of public health agencies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After launching a national vaccine safety and   informed consent movement in the US in the early 1980&rsquo;s, NVIC&rsquo;s co-founders   worked with Congress to create the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of   1986. This historic law set up a vaccine injury compensation program and   included vaccine safety provisions such as mandatory recording and reporting of   hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following vaccination.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, NVIC sponsored an International Scientific   Workshop on Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccines and, in 1996, one of NVIC&rsquo;s major   goals was realized when a purified pertussis vaccine was licensed for American   babies after a decade and a half of advocacy work. In 1997, NVIC held the First   International Public Conference on Vaccination and will sponsor the Second   International Public Conference on Vaccination on Sept. 8-10, 2000 in   Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n<p>Barbara Loe Fisher is cofounder and president of the   National Vaccine Information Center. She is co-author of DPT: A Shot in the Dark   (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985; Warner, 1986; Avery, 1991) and author of The   Consumer&rsquo;s Guide to Childhood Vaccines (NVIC,1997). She is editor of THE   VACCINE</p>\r\n<p>REACTION and The Vaccine Hotline. During the 1980&rsquo;s,   she helped lead a national grassroots effort to bring the issue of vaccine   safety to public attention, including leading demonstrations at the Centers for   Disease Control in Atlanta and at the White House in 1986. Later that year,   Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;She served on the National Vaccine Advisory   Committee at the Department of Health and Human Services for four years, where   she was the chair of the subcommittee on adverse events. She was appointed to   the Vaccine Safety Forum at the Institute of Medicine in 1995, where she has   helped coordinate five public workshops on vaccine safety and is the consumer   voting member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory   Committee.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of three children, in 1980 her oldest   son reacted within hours of his fourth DPT and OPV vaccinations at the age of   two and a half with a convulsion, collapse shock and six hour state of   unconsciousness. During the following weeks, he suffered physical, mental and   emotional regression including severe gastrointestinal dysfunction, failure to   thrive, respiratory and ear infections, personality change, and loss of   cognitive, memory, concentration and motor skills. He was eventually diagnosed   with multiple learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no family history of learning   disabilities, ADHD, or neurological disorders, however, there is a strong family   history of autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, allergies   to foods, drugs and vaccines, ulcerative colitis, migraine, diabetes, and   thyroid disease. Her son, who was above average in intelligence, development and   health when he suffered his vaccine reaction, was the only one of her three   babies with an allergy to milk. He had suffered a severe local reaction to his   third DPT shot and was given his fourth DPT shot while he was recovering from   the flu.</p>\r\n<strong>\r\n<p align=\"center\">******</p>\r\n</strong>\r\n<p>THE VACCINE REACTION is a publication of the National   Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), a national non-profit organization dedicated   to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education.
