Here's a quick look at a few times the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism has been debunked. </p><p>First, and most notably, an anti-vaccination group called SafeMinds once funded a six-year study to prove \u2014 once and for all \u2014 that vaccines cause autism. After the data was in, sorted, and analyzed, the study <a href=\"http://http//www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12498.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">found no link between vaccines and autism. </a>The study observed 79 monkeys in six different groups. Two of the groups were give the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is most often said to cause autism by anti-vaccination groups. Two of the other groups were given vaccines that contain thimerosal, an antifungal that was suspect. The final two were control groups. The authors of the study wrote:</p><div class=\"pull-quote\">No behavioral changes were observed in the vaccinated animals, nor were there neuropathological changes in the cerebellum, hippocampus, or amygdala. This study does not support the hypothesis that thimerosal-containing vaccines and/or MMR vaccine play a role in the etiology of autism.</div><p>Of course, these results were less than satisfactory to SafeMinds. They put out a statement that said they had \"concerns about changes in the study design protocol and analysis that may have <a href=\"http://www.safeminds.org/blog/2015/10/05/why-arent-i-surprised-that-the-media-got-it-wrong-again/\" target=\"_blank\">led to these contradictory results</a>.\" </p><div class=\"post-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">based on the findings of a very flawed study.

The journal <em>Jama </em><a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444#Results\" target=\"_blank\">studied 100,000 children who received</a> the MMR vaccine, as well as the frequency of autism in their families. They found that even for the children who had siblings with autism, the vaccine did not increase their risk of having autism. The researchers wrote, \"These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD.\" </p><div class=\"post-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I was called an antivaxxer...just because i pointed out Scientific FACT regarding documented dangers associated... <a href=\"https://t.co/KDlykM9cBa\">https://t.co/KDlykM9cBa</a></p>\u2014 pandora sage (@pandorasage) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pandorasage/status/731201525922439169\">May 13, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p>Another study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, had nearly identical conclusions. The study compared about 500,000 children with about 100,000 who didn't. There were no differences in the appearance of autism between the two groups. nearly half a million kids who got the vaccine were compared with some 100,000 who didn't, and there were no differences in the autism rates between the two groups. The authors wrote, \"This study provides <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa021134\" target=\"_blank\">strong evidence against the hypothesis</a> that MMR vaccination causes autism.\" The evidence goes on and on. </p><div class=\"post-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today my Immunology professor said that if anyone in class was an antivaxxer she'd fail them on the spot.

There is a lot we don't know about autism \u2014 that's true. But vaccinations have been effective and life-saving since their invention. There is no link between the two, and skipping out on vaccines because researchers are still studying autism isn't just ill-informed; it's dangerous. </p></div> </div> <div class=\"post-footer\"> <div class=\"post-author\"> <a rel=\"author\" href=\"/authors/zoe-balaconis-1376\"><x-image><noscript> <img src=\"https://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/1376/9b0eaec0-dcbe-0133-d0be-0e4e2f3f58fb.jpg?w=160&amp;h=80&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70\" srcset=\"https://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/1376/9b0eaec0-dcbe-0133-d0be-0e4e2f3f58fb.jpg?w=160&amp;h=80&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 160w, https://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/1376/9b0eaec0-dcbe-0133-d0be-0e4e2f3f58fb.jpg?w=160&amp;h=80&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 320w\" sizes=\"160px\"> </noscript> </x-image></a> <div class=\"post-author-info\"> <a class=\"post-author-name\" rel=\"author\" href=\"/authors/zoe-balaconis-1376\">Zoe Balaconis</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"share-buttons bottom\"> <a data-is=\"share-button\" data-type=\"facebook\" class=\"share-button\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.romper.com%2Fp%2Fevidence-that-vaccines-cause-autism-that-has-been-disproven-11739%3Futm_source%3DFBOnsite%26utm_medium%3DFacebook%26utm_campaign%3D1\" title=\"Share\"><i class=\"icon-facebook\"></i></a> <a data-is=\"share-button\" data-type=\"twitter\" class=\"share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.romper.com%2Fp%2Fevidence-that-vaccines-cause-autism-that-has-been-disproven-11739&amp;text=Evidence%20That%20Vaccines%20Cause%20Autism%20That%20Has%20Been%20Disproven&amp;via=romper\" title=\"Tweet\"><i class=\"icon-twitter\"></i></a> <a data-is=\"share-button\" data-type=\"pinterest\" class=\"share-button\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.romper.com%2Fp%2Fevidence-that-vaccines-cause-autism-that-has-been-disproven-11739&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Ftypeset-beta.imgix.net%2F2016%2F6%2F2%2F464478036.jpg&amp;description=Evidence%20That%20Vaccines%20Cause%20Autism%20That%20Has%20Been%20Disproven\" title=\"Pin it\"><i class=\"icon-pinterest\"></i></a> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <clip-feed name=\"footerFeed\"></clip-feed> </post-page></main> <script src=\"https://d2hud39msfk901.cloudfront.net/romper/production/assets/vendor-6b0b94a9844d01a48e053169081e4146.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://d2hud39msfk901.cloudfront.net/romper/production/assets/app-4ea2ff701d60f1b7a7e08b0d78fa1ea3.js\"></script> <script> window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date; ga('create', 'UA-40141401-6', 'auto'); !function(f,n){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod? n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n; n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[]}(window); fbq('init', '932972280084675'); var ezt = [{ qacct: 'p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg', uid: '' }]; var _comscore = [{ c1: '2', c2: '17519299' }]; var __reach_config = { pid: '564f8b97736b7970bb001740' }; var _sf_async_config = { uid: 50134, domain: 'romper.com', useCanonical: true }; </script> <script src=\"https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\" async></script> <script src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js\" async></script> <script src=\"https://secure.quantserve.com/aquant.js?a=p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg\" async></script> <script src=\"https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\" async></script> <script src=\"https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/rs/pt/gg.js\" async></script> <script src=\"https://static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat.js\" async></script> <noscript style=\"display:none\"> <img src=\"https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif\"/> <img src=\"http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cv=2.0&cj=1\"/> <img src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=932972280084675&ev=PageView&noscript=1\"/> </noscript> <script>require('app').create({ model: {\"id\":11739,\"type\":\"ARTICLE\",\"title\":\"Evidence That Vaccines Cause Autism That Has Been Disproven\",\"slug\":\"evidence-that-vaccines-cause-autism-that-has-been-disproven-11739\",\"rating\":\"G\",\"publishedAt\":1464909099783,\"updatedAt\":1464909099782,\"bodies\":[{\"version\":\"0.3.0\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"embed-card\",{\"type\":\"link\",\"attribution\":\"Matt on Twitter\",\"attribution_url\":\"https://twitter.com/TheDrChuck/status/733666709287108608\",\"provider_name\":\"Twitter\",\"title\":\"Matt on Twitter\",\"html\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">based on the findings of a very flawed study.

Two of the groups were give the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is most often said to cause autism by anti-vaccination groups. Two of the other groups were given vaccines that contain thimerosal, an antifungal that was suspect. The final two were control groups.

The journal \"],[0,[3],1,\"Jama \"],[0,[4],1,\"studied 100,000 children who received\"],[0,[],0,\" the MMR vaccine, as well as the frequency of autism in their families. They found that even for the children who had siblings with autism, the vaccine did not increase their risk of having autism.
