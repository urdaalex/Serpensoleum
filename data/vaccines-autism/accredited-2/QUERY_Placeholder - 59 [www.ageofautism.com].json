title=\"Traitors\" /></a>By Cathy Jameson</p>\r\n<p>Vaccines cause autism.&#0160; Or, is it vaccines result in autism?&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>You say tomato.&#0160; I say to-mah-to.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Cause it.&#0160; Result in it.&#0160; Vaccines did it.&#0160; You know it. &#0160;I know it.&#0160; And now, come to find out, our <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user5503203/review/103711143/91f7d3d4d8\" target=\"_blank\">government apparently knew it too</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For years now more than enough people have suggested that vaccines cause autism.&#0160; Several have tried to prove it.&#0160; Try as they might, those who should have acknowledged it have turned a blind eye.&#0160; Not only did they do that, but they adamantly defended themselves with skewed statistics.&#0160; News of these skewed statistics came from someone working at the CDC.&#0160; The CDC\u2019s slogan is <em>Saving Lives.&#0160; Protecting People</em>.&#0160; After last week\u2019s news I can\u2019t help but ask whose lives were they trying to save?&#0160; Their own?&#0160; Whose lives were they protecting?&#0160; Themselves?&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Relying on paperwork instead of listening to those who\u2019ve been negatively affected by vaccines has kept officials\u2019 heads in the clouds.&#0160; Having their heads in the clouds gives them a free pass.&#0160; It looks like that free pass was used by several people.&#0160; According to the whistleblower, they didn\u2019t factually report their findings.&#0160; They didn\u2019t accurately inform the public.&#0160; They didn\u2019t reveal dangers associated with vaccines.&#0160; They didn\u2019t publicly state the truth.&#0160; That vaccines come with risks.&#0160; That they\u2019re loaded with side effects.&#0160; That they don\u2019t offer lifelong immunity.&#0160; And that they cause autism.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Mind you that none of this information is new; it\u2019s just kept so hush hush that unless you or a loved one has experienced a vaccine injury, it goes under the radar.&#0160; Only when vaccine injury hits close to home is one forced to go back, read the fine print and put two and two together.&#0160; Unfortunately, at that point, they\u2019re left to fend for themselves.&#0160; When vaccines cause autism, a vaccine injured is left high and dry.&#0160; That\u2019s because the vaccines industry is protected by the government, the same government that evidently knew that vaccines cause autism.&#0160; Rather than looking out for and protecting the ones they\u2019re meant to serve, the vaccine industry and those who oversee it have chosen to protect each other.&#0160;</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t<a id=\"more\"></a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-more font-entrybody\">\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>Fortunately, some people are taking a step away from the bureaucracy and toward the truth.&#0160; Surely taking that step came with risks, but isn\u2019t honesty usually the best policy?&#0160; I\u2019d like to think it is.&#0160;<br /><br /><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e201a511fc23c9970c-pi\" /></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/cdc-whistleblower-forward-admits-coverup-on-vaccine-link-to-autism/\" target=\"_blank\">CDC whistleblower breaks his silence after 13 years</a>&#0160;</em></p>\r\n<p>So what\u2019s the next step?&#0160; Last week Thompson came clean.&#0160; Will the others follow suit?&#0160; Will the story be quickly buried like other vaccine stories are buried? &#0160;Or will what\u2019s been revealed soon merit breaking news status across mainstream channels?&#0160; If it does, will the badgering of vaccine safety proponents and of parents who exercise their right to opt out of vaccines end?&#0160; And will the public finally realize that our government\u2019s deafening silence forced many of us to become vocal about the vaccine-autism link?&#0160; I\u2019m anxiously waiting to see what news, if any, will be shared and if any of those questions will be answered.</p>\r\n<p>I\u2019d like to believe that some good will come from this situation.&#0160; I\u2019d like to think that the stories and links that blew up my newsfeed last week crossed over to mainstream channels.&#0160; I\u2019d like to hope that my non-autism parent friends\u2019 eyebrows raised as they saw the story flash across their newsfeeds too.&#0160; I\u2019d like to believe that an in-depth investigation will occur and that the results will be shared far and wide so that more parents can be empowered with the truth. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Knowing the truth is better than being placated with fabrications made by crooked officials.&#0160; Those fabrications need to stop.&#0160; So many people have been hurt in the name of science, science we\u2019ve recently learned has been based on fraud.&#0160; Too many too soon and too little too late.&#0160; That sounds terrible, but it seems to be a more accurate theme for today\u2019s vaccine program.&#0160; Our children deserve better.&#0160; We all do.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Cathy Jameson is a

other medical issues cause autism. Do they cause autism in and of themselves in people with normal immune systems and no genetic disorders? Never.</p>\n\n<p>That is the problem today however: The CDC is saying &quot;In EVERYONE vaccines do not cause autism!&quot;<br />\nThat is a lie. It is a known lie.</p>\n\n<p>We could avoid the vaccine related autism simply by screening people for certain genetic disorders known to cause vaccination when connected with autism but the CDC and big pharmaceuticals do not want to admit that because they want to deny ANY culpability period.</p>\n\n<p>Vaccines are a net benefit to society however the thing to credit for the lesser amounts of mumps, measles, etc. is BETTER HYGIENE.

Autism is something you&#39;re born with, you either have it, or you don&#39;t. It is physically impossible for vaccines to cause autism since they happen after birth. Autism can&#39;t just be &quot;acquired&quot; from a vaccine. if a child is vaccinated and begins showing signs of autism, it is not because of the vaccines, the child had autism the whole time but the symptoms were just beginning to show up. The whole &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; debate is just a way for parents to pin the blame on someone else because of what happened to their children. Honestly, I can&#39;t really blame them.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tCommon S. |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1eec9c9970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1eec9c9970c\">May 28, 2016 at 04:10 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c85b4198970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c85b4198970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c85b4198970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/19-50si.gif\" alt=\"Susan George\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c85b4198970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c85b4198970b-content\"><p>It&#39;s possible that autism numbers are going up due to folate and Vitamin B levels in mothers that are too high.

However, vaccines have never claimed to be safe. Sadly, there us a chance of being injured by a vaccine. The risk is very low, with less than 1% of vaccinated persons reporting serious injury. This data can be found on the CDC&#39;s website. The government admits that vaccines are not safe for all children, with immunocompromised kids unable to be vaccinated. Another thing to consider is that children less than 1 year old, usually between 2 and 6 months of age, are most likely to begin being vaccinated.  At this age, infants are at greatest risk for certain medical adverse events, including high fevers, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some infants will experience these medical events shortly after a vaccination by coincidence. This data is pulled from the VAERS website, a government site that allows people to report adverse effects caused by vaccines. The government does not ignore those affected, and the data is easily available. Vaccines are promoted because they have been proven to reduce the chance of coming down with a possibly deadly disease. The chances of being injured by a vaccine is low and worth it when you consider the thousands of children that die of preventable diseases in countries lacking access to vaccines.Vaccines have saved countless lives, and should not be feared. Smallpox was not eliminated by a cleaner world. Vaccines did their job to eradicate the awful disease. Vaccines are not the cause of autism or other developmental disorders. Coincidence and timing of vaccine injections  to when most disorders are noticed has caused a lot of unnecessary fear. </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tMar\u00eda Aja |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8292fbc970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8292fbc970b\">March 24, 2016 at 07:37 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/02-50si.gif\" alt=\",......\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b-content\"><p>where is your evidence??<br />\n</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t,...... |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c8102d26970b\">February 02, 2016 at 01:09 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/12-50si.gif\" alt=\"Hera \" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d-content\"><p>Hi Kohl, <br />\nIn the comments below there is a link to over a hundred peer reviewed journal articles suggesting a link between vaccination and autism.</p>\n\n<p>You also ask why &quot;everybody&quot; doesn&#39;t get autism from vaccines. </p>\n\n<p>That applies to almost every reaction and disease.<br />\nCan you explain why a peanut allergy can kill some people yet I can eat peanuts?<br />\nAccording to your logic, peanuts can&#39;t cause an allergic reaction, or everyone would react to peanuts.<br />\nWhat about people with life threatening reactions to strawberries ,or shellfish, or those who get sick from wheat (celiacs?)<br />\nCan you eat these things?<br />\nIf so, does that mean that all these people (and their doctors) are lying?<br />\nDoes that mean the people who died from allergic reactions to these things did not really die?<br />\nDo you tell these people that you can eat peanuts, so everyone who says they react badly to them is wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Or do you think it is possible that some people can react differently than other people ?</p>\n\n<p>Actually even the manufacturers have acknowledged that some people will be injured or die from vaccines.<br />\nIn fact that is the reason we have the federal governments vaccine court. It was developed to give compensation to people who died or had lifelong injuries from vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>It is called VAERS. You can google it.<br />\nIs all autism caused by vaccines? No, about 6% of autism is genetic ( fragile X etc).</p>\n\n<p>But autism rates have increased from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 68.  According to the National Autism Association, about 40% of people with autism do not speak. Ever.( though some &quot;regress&quot; and loose the ability to speak that they were developing as young infants.)</p>\n\n<p>Do you really think that doctors and parents in the 70&#39;s  never noticed that their children weren&#39;t able to speak? they just said &quot;Johnny is doing just fine&quot; , and sent him off to school, where the teacher did not notice anything either?</p>\n\n<p>It seems very unlikely, doesn&#39;t it, and we are talking huge numbers of people that couldn&#39;t ever talk, even as adults yet who no one noticed existed. </p>\n\n<p><br />\n</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tHera  |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08a5b4cd970d\">January 01, 2016 at 11:37 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/05-50si.gif\" alt=\"Kohl\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d-content\"><p>Vaxcined dont cause autism the ride of autism at the same time as vaxcines is become ALL medical science advanced at that time including the DETECTION of autism bought not the cause and if there was something that outright causes autism first why would your doctor&#39;s the ones trying to keep you healthy give you come thing that could make you soo sick aND second if it alone CAUSES autism than why doesn&#39;t every human who ever got vaxinated have autism and show me one peace of TRUE and pruveable evedence or a REPEATABLE experiment than Mable I will beleve you and here proffered you&#39;ll understand <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nDjz5qHIzsc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nDjz5qHIzsc</a></p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tKohl |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb089f8d33970d\">December 16, 2015 at 08:40 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7ee91af970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7ee91af970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7ee91af970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/03-50si.gif\" alt=\"WILLIE\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7ee91af970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7ee91af970b-content\"><p>VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM</p>\n\n<p>I have been saying that just like the above for about 7 years now on all my post here at AOA.

I don&#39;t see a single source anywhere.  In fact, I believe the only source was a comment containing a link to a 480p low quality youtube video.  Not a credible source.<br />\nI&#39;ll focus on what appears to be the headline of this website - mercury is in vaccines.<br />\nAgain, ignoring the fact there is no evidence (that one paper that was immediately disproven as fraudulent and a scheme to promote alternative methods of disease prevention... you know what I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m not linking it because if you don&#39;t know what it is, you don&#39;t need to), vaccines contain thimerosal.  Thimerosal is a form of mercury, specifically ethylmercury.  The CDC does actually inform us thimerosal is in vaccines, here.  <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/</a><br />\nI&#39;m assuming that since this website still receives comments everybody conveniently ignores that in 1999 the CDC and FDA decided to reduce the content of thimerosal in vaccines.  In 1999, 6 vaccines out of 31 administered regularly to children under 6 contained ethylmercury: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228</a><br />\nSince then, only 2 still contain thimerosal.</p>\n\n<p>Even then, we know thimerosal DOES NOT HARM THE BODY.<br />\n<a href=\"http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=DA-SORT&docType=Article&tabID=T003&prodId=GPS&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=BasicSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=1&searchResultsType=SingleTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=carmelhs&docId=GALE%7CA223908626&contentSet=GALE%7CA223908626\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=DA-SORT&amp;docType=Article&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=GPS&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;contentSegment=&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;inPS=true&amp;userGroupName=carmelhs&amp;docId=GALE%7CA223908626&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA223908626</a><br />\nFirst of all, that is what a real source looks like.  Second of all, here is the first sentence in case you don&#39;t want to read:</p>\n\n<p>Three judges ruled March 12 in three separate cases that thimerosal, a preservative containing mercury that has been used in some vaccines, does not cause autism, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to quote another line from the source:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A normal fish-eating diet by pregnant mothers&quot; is more likely to deposit mercury in the brain than vaccines are, she wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Literally, you are more likely to &quot;cause autism&quot; in your child by eating tuna or sushi than you are with a vaccine.  Again, we are assuming ethylmercury causes autism (which, again, it does not).</p>\n\n<p>Another comment I&#39;ve seen: &quot;but what about the increased rates of autism?  Clearly the government is to blame, what with their vaccines trying to kill us!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a scientific journal:<br />\n<a href=\"http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=DA-SORT&docType=Brief+article%2C+Report&tabID=T002&prodId=GPS&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=BasicSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=4&searchResultsType=SingleTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=carmelhs&docId=GALE%7CA179080831&contentSet=GALE%7CA179080831\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=DA-SORT&amp;docType=Brief+article%2C+Report&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=GPS&amp;searchId=R2&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;contentSegment=&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;inPS=true&amp;userGroupName=carmelhs&amp;docId=GALE%7CA179080831&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA179080831</a></p>\n\n<p>In case you are too lazy to read once again:</p>\n\n<p>But a recent investigation of data collected in California suggests that the elimination of thimerosal has not lowered the autism rate, which increased steadily throughout the study period (1995 to 2007).</p>\n\n<p>There is zero connection of thimerosal (50% ethylmercury) to autism.  You are putting your child in more danger by leaving them vulnerable to polio, measles, and other life-threatening diseases which by the way, have killed far more people than autism.  If you really wanted your child to live, you&#39;d vaccinate.

Vaccines do NOT cause autism, it is simply that some vaccines are given to children at around the time when the &quot;symptoms,&quot; I suppose one would call them, begin to show. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is not a sickness or a disease obtained through substances entering the body. A person with autism is BORN WITH autism, but only starts to show signs of autism around age three, near the time when many vaccines are administered to the child. My family, for example, has never had someone with autism, even though we have all received vaccines at around the designated times. Furthermore, autism, in some cases, may be caused by the environment in which a fetus develops- for example, if the mother is smoking (nicotine) or ingesting drugs (includes alcohol) somehow. These links are not concrete, but to the point- AUTISM IS NOT CAUSED BY ANY CAUSE AFTER THE SUBJECT&#39;S BIRTH. THIS INCLUDES VACCINES.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tAgent Pom-Pom |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7cfe4b2970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7cfe4b2970b\">September 18, 2015 at 01:10 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/12-50si.gif\" alt=\"Hera\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c-content\"><p>Good suggestions Linda1.</p>\n\n<p>And David, if you can stomach it, you might want to follow up with this youtube video. 6 minutes of your time, and you don&#39;t even have to watch the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu7C5clA4q0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu7C5clA4q0</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the autism that is not like yours.</p>\n\n<p>But I am very glad that your life is going really well and is happy; that is wonderful news. </p>\n\n<p>If you feel a bit embarrassed after realizing what severe autism looks like, don&#39;t worry; lots of people aren&#39;t aware either.<br />\nWishing you all the best<br />\nHera</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tHera |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d1493de5970c\">August 14, 2015 at 11:43 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7bf041a970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7bf041a970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7bf041a970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/01-50si.gif\" alt=\"Linda1\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7bf041a970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7bf041a970b-content\"><p>David,<br />\nIn the left margin of this blog there is a video showing a brother and sister in black and white entitled, &quot;Autism Public Service Announcement&quot;.

Period. Autism is due to a degraded or non-existent corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is the nerve highway in the brain that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. The corpus callosum grows during fetal development. So there&#39;s no way a vaccine, given much later in life, after the development of the corpus callosum, could cause it. </p>\n\n<p>What agents in a vaccine could target only the nerve cells in the corpus callosum, composed of the same cells and material as all other nerves, leaving all other nerves intact? Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>So, autism is due to a degraded or missing corpus callosum that develops with the growing fetus. No compounds, chemicals, or whatever has ever been identified in vaccines that could only affect specific nerve cells while ignoring others -- they&#39;re all made from the same.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tTired of Lies |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d147993e970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d147993e970c\">August 11, 2015 at 05:37 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/09-50si.gif\" alt=\"dolan\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c-content\"><p>this article and these toxic comments are the reson autisim exists (and mabey crystal meth)</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html\">dolan</a> |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d138193f970c\">July 14, 2015 at 09:12 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7a9d606970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7a9d606970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7a9d606970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/11-50si.gif\" alt=\"Loreala \" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7a9d606970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7a9d606970b-content\"><p>It&#39;s absurd, that obsessed, pharma puppet Dorit Reiss is STILL defending Gardasil,and claiming it is safe (LOL) Can you believe the nerve?

Social issues, poor language development etc etc.<br />\nA headache is also a symptom. The symptom &quot;headache&quot; can have multiple causes. You could have a brain tumor, have hit your head, or get migraine headaches from the wrong types of food.<br />\nSimilarly, autism is diagnosed only by symptoms.<br />\nAccording to a variety of studies, you can get these types of symptoms from <br />\nbeing born with fragile X ( a genetic disorder that is never routinely tested for)<br />\nHaving agenesis of the corpus callosum ( a fancy way of saying missing part of the brain)<br />\nHaving brain damage. ( If someone gets a bad enough head injury, they can show symptoms of autism..)<br />\nBeing injected with a vaccine and getting encephalitis ( Hannah Poling was declared to have symptoms of autism by the federal government after her vaccine injury)<br />\nHope this is helpful to you.<br />\n </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tHera |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d10b1637970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d10b1637970c\">April 28, 2015 at 11:29 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c78139cb970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c78139cb970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c78139cb970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/01-50si.gif\" alt=\"Stephanie\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c78139cb970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c78139cb970b-content\"><p>Curious as to what evidence you have that makes you think the CDC skews their statistics?

Are you aware that in 1977 ten babies in a Toronto hospital died when an antiseptic containing thimerosal ( the mercury in vaccines) was mistakenly dabbed on their umbilical cord sites.<br />\nBy the way, our digestive systems handle mercury better than when we inject it. Eating and injecting is not the same. If you think about it, you can drink apple juice. But do you think injecting it would necessarily be safe?<br />\nYou have told us &quot;stories&quot; about children who caught a disease and blamed unvaccinated children..

I am all ears........</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://aol.com\" href=\"http://aol.com\">Benedetta</a> |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fafaac970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fafaac970c\">April 02, 2015 at 11:53 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/05-50si.gif\" alt=\"Angus Files\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d-content\"><p>Good evening Liam don\u2019t take us the wrong  way or think we are trying to insult your intelligence either .You see on here at AOA  most of us report as parents of vaccine damaged children from all corners of the world ,and we all have the same similar  stories to tell. Our babies vaccinated  with a vaccine, and straight after a catastrophic change ,high temps, red rash, encephalitis, green puss coming from the ears, high pitched scream  this is straight after the vaccine has been administered some babies die. The \u201clucky \u201cones survive and mostly need 24 hour care for the duration of life ,life at a level  which you cannot even imagine. For the record  we were all pro-vaccine at one time, if we weren\u2019t our poor babies wouldn\u2019t have got in this situation in the first place and I for sure wouldn\u2019t be hanging over a computer typing to you at close on midnight (I\u2019m anti vaccine and proud of it just in case you haven\u2019t guessed). <br />\nWhatever planet you come from  to us humans on earth Mercury is toxic in any form whether it be ethyl mercury, methylmercury  or breathing it from you amalgam fillings ,you\u2019re a dead man walking if you start taking it in any size or form. On plant Liam you can eat it abundantly brilliant\u2026. The funny thing is (ha ha),is that the main studies that say vaccines don\u2019t cause Autism were falsified and this has been admitted to by whistle blower William Thompson of the CDC to whom we are eternally  grateful. Just scroll on here and you can see how the news unfolded.Again hundreds of studies prove vaccines cause Autism ,hundreds.<br />\nIf you have the time the link below is of a  brilliant great Dr called Russell Blaylock take the time to listen to this video below.He has many more start with this<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiFqwzxKqp0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiFqwzxKqp0</a></p>\n\n<p>MMR RIP<br />\n.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tAngus Files |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb08153e95970d\">April 02, 2015 at 06:39 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/16-50si.gif\" alt=\"Liam\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c-content\"><p>All of you people claim that vaccines cause autism, even criticizing the test results and evidence against the claim.  Even the original test that claimed that vaccines cause autism was disproven after errors were found in the method of the test.  Yet still people want to believe something that was disproven years and years ago because it is all they could think of.  </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not trying to insult you or people in your life that may have autism, I&#39;m just stating the fact that the source in your claim is very wrong.  Firstly I want to say that many people think that vaccines contain mercury, and correct them, because they no longer do, and when they did decades ago, it was non-toxic compound of mercury.  In fact mercury itself isn&#39;t even very dangerous, just toxic compunds like Dimethylmercury and Metyhlmercury.  In fact mercury is in food like sword fish and sushi, that&#39;s why you cannot eat too much but small amounts, like in the 20th century vaccines which contained non-toxic mercury compounds.  Think of it like chlorine and sodium, both are deadly, but together they are safe and we need them to survive.  Now back to just vaccines, as I was saying there hasn&#39;t been any reliable evidence towards your claim.  There are many stories where children who aren&#39;t vaccinated cause extreme sickness in other vaccinated children, who even though were vaccinated couldn&#39;t be protected against ignorant dismissive people.  Vaccines in order to stop diseases need everyone&#39;s cooperation, if you aren&#39;t going to vaccinate your children, keep them out of public schools until they are vaccinated.  That is for the safety of others, which by not vaccinating your children you are destroying. </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tLiam |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0fac40e970c\">April 02, 2015 at 04:16 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/02-50si.gif\" alt=\"For Sasha\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b-content\"><p>Hi Sasha</p>\n\n<p>You might to look here and see how many vaccines and infant has had by 6 months</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf</a></p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tFor Sasha |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7712719970b\">April 02, 2015 at 03:11 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/16-50si.gif\" alt=\"Sasha\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b-content\"><p>I&#39;m sorry if your kid has autism but blaming a vaccine is crazy.  Science has proven when they did they study they only used autistic kids so they didn&#39;t have a control group.  You can&#39;t say well almost all the kids here have autism so since they all had shots that has to be the reason.  There are tons of kids that have nothing wrong with them that have been vaccinated.  My friends son has autism and you could tell when he was like 6 months old that something wasn&#39;t right.  He had a blank stare he wouldn&#39;t look at you in the eyes he didn&#39;t respond when you would say his name.  His mom just got him help.  She never spent time blaming a shot or a doctor or anyone.  I wish more people were like her.  </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tSasha |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c77119a2970b\">April 02, 2015 at 01:42 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/13-50si.gif\" alt=\"Jeannette Bishop\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b-content\"><p>To &quot;You are...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Are you advising we trust a group that is essentially enthusiastically pedaling their shining new bicycle (vaccine schedule) on a &quot;liability free&quot; slope, upgraded every few years with more gadgets and gizmos and shiny dangling in-their-eyes boondoggles, who frequently turn to look behind them and shout, &quot;Look, Mom!  No hands (control group)!?! and has no idea why we have so many injured children in the whereabouts of the side walk or where it looks (to us at least) like they are headed?  At this point I think the feet are coming off the pedals, the speed governed now more by the slippery slope than the pedaling, and I&#39;m not sure any amount of breaking can prevent a full-stop crash.</p>\n\n<p>No one here went to the internet and said, &quot;I like this narrative about what I&#39;m seeing and hearing in regards to what&#39;s going on with my child.  Yes!  Vaccine injury!  Environmental injury!  That&#39;s the ticket.  I&#39;m going to latch onto this!&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>To the contrary it is about as unappealing a narrative as it is to those who are desperately pedaling blind, maybe more--I can&#39;t tell you what it was like to start waking up to the concept of vaccine/immune system injury even though (or maybe because) I&#39;d been living in a family probably burdened with various degrees of it for generations.  </p>\n\n<p>We, I, to a great extent chose the environment, including the vaccines (though the system is revealing quite clearly with a country wide legislative push that vaccination was never intended to be voluntary on the part of some)?!?  I chose, through little investigation on my part, to subject my child to more of what I&#39;d hoped I could protect her from!  And I did it with the help/pressure of many trusted institutions, also apparently not cognizant of how compromised the information they were promoting was (or maybe just plain prepared to be self-serving, even at the expense of the health tiny, vulnerable infants).  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a pretty sucky, uncomfortable view of how fallible, blind (or corrupt) human institutions can be.  Why would anyone &quot;choose&quot; to see things this way, if there wasn&#39;t anything to it, if this wasn&#39;t the view necessary to scrutinize to uncover real remedy and healing?</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tJeannette Bishop |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c76f9113970b\">March 31, 2015 at 04:58 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0f9119d970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0f9119d970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0f9119d970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/08-50si.gif\" alt=\"Managing Editor\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0f9119d970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0f9119d970c-content\"><p>We&#39;ve allowed the negative comments because they say far more about the commenters than the topic of vaccine injury.

If you&#39;re quoting him as backup to your anti-vax stance, then you obviously haven&#39;t done enough research to make an informed decision. Wakefield was proven to be a crock and a liar several years ago. He wasn&#39;t even a real doctor and he admitted that his &quot;study&quot; on the autism-vaccination link was fake. Wake up, people. Vaccines do not cause autism. People think they do because symptoms of autism show up around the same time that children get a lot of their vaccines. There is no &quot;autism epidemic&quot;.  Autism has been around forever. You just recently started hearing about it because its finally being diagnosed correctly. Doctors used to diagnose autistic children with mental retardation. As a result of correct diagnosis, cases of mental retardation have drastically declined, just as cases of autism have skyrocketed. Why? Because what used to be called mental retardation is now called autism. Do your research. Don&#39;t rely on Google and hearsay. Don&#39;t let your child contract a disease that is easily preventable. Save lives. Vaccinate. </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tJocelyn |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0d101c9970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0d101c9970c\">February 06, 2015 at 12:12 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c747831e970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c747831e970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c747831e970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/11-50si.gif\" alt=\"Katie\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c747831e970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c747831e970b-content\"><p>VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM YOU ARE BORN WITH AUTISM.

I simply though of a potential cause of mental illness in children and wanted officials to investigate or research it; and I have tried papers and books in that regard only; although books and scientific paper were never my intention. So, now I am trying another approach to get what I wanted in the first place; and that is why I commented on this website because I thought it was a good place to give my opinions but I did not want to simply come out and say what was on my mind because people usually ignore things unless you can bring them to the same conclusion little by little; and so I thought that by given some of the history on autism, and some of the questions, that I could at least get them to listen to my opinion; but I got no responses. Nevertheless, I do not want anyone to make any decision based on what I say because I am not a researcher. I have no qualification to do so. I basely have opinions like anyone else.    </p>\n\n<p>So, all that I am saying is that officials should research hallucination distortions because maybe that is what causes all mind and or brain (distortion) disorders in children. Maybe, brain and mind development is very sensitive and maybe it is even a program that is distorted; and thus cause distortion illnesses; and maybe, autism is a distortion illness. In my opinion, the measles vaccine somehow stimulates the brain to cause a hallucination of one, two or many or all of the images in the child\u2019s brain, and thus that maybe causes ASD; but I am not researcher and I am not a doctor; and I do not want anyone to make any decision, particularly a medical one,  based on anything that I say. Please consider this as some sort of declaimer that releases me from any damage that may result because of my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>There you have it; the thing that I have been trying to get officials to act on for the past year or so.  Since your comment, I have been thinking that maybe I should contact the autism society, maybe meet with them; and ask them to call for a research proposal (sort of a tender)to investigate the possibility of the distorting type of hallucination causing autism and maybe even all atypical mind disorder in children, maybe also along with the possibility of the MMR vaccine causing autism by somehow causing hallucinations; I know that inflammation of the brain has been documented and maybe that could have caused Autismor an hallucination that caused Autism) and i think that they will find that the MMR vaccination indeed can cause hallucinations; and in that regard; you may not recognize a hallucination in children before they get autism because it may cause the condition immediately, that is if indeed it causes the condition at all; and we may not even know the symptoms in young children because indeed it would be different than in adults because, in my opinion, you can only hallucination by what you previous seen except in simple hallucinations such as maybe moving images that do not really move before the concept of movement is developed; and maybe a better example would be distort the size such as instead of a uniform size, the images has various sizes, etc. But once again; I must say that I am going by my opinions only and that I may be wrong; and the whole concept of hallucinations causing problems in children may also be wrong; but I don\u2019t think so. They must do something and it cannot be good; and if they do anything, then it must give some problem and then that come first; and then the genetic changes or modifications must come second; and that is in compliance I think with evolution maybe; and also is just my opinion and therefore also it may be wrong\u2019 but basically I just wanted to get it out there to the public to do as they see fit without upsetting the apple cart.  </p>\n\n<p>So, once again thank you and thank you for bringing out \u2018the cause of autism and other mind distortion illnesses in children according to Peter\u201d; who may be wrong, and take care of that wonderful grandson; and I agree with you and everybody else, the MMR is the main cause of autism and as a fellow says below, but there are probably other causes and basically anything that causes hallucinations, I think would do it but when it occurs after the MMR, then obvious the MMR causes it, like I say, probably by causing a hallucination; and we know that seizures are common; and whether that can be confused with hallucinations, I do not know; but I would think that they both involve increased neurotransmitters; and I know and seizures were once associated with certain deficiencies, I believe calcium but I am unsure and they generally did no harm or at least in most cases, although they are also associated with other things as we know but not with mind distortion and I know that hallucination are common at least in some children after the condition which also probably depends on the age of the child, etc ?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you again.    </p>\n\n<p>Now I can put this issue to rest. That is what ages makes you want to do. Thanks.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tPeter |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0d03e06970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0d03e06970c\">February 05, 2015 at 06:47 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/12-50si.gif\" alt=\"Hera\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b-content\"><p>If you wish to call yourself &quot;Science&quot;, a process that in fact is ever evolving and follows data, then you probably should learn to read an article in full before you cite it, and also not just read but learn to practice critical thinking skills..<br />\nThe Snopes article itself confirms Dr Thompsons statement that &quot;:the omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before 36 months were at risk of autism&quot;<br />\nApparently the &quot;false &quot; bit comes because the CDC ( you know the SAME government agency that chose to omit the data and could be facing fraud charges) said something along the lines of ( paraphrasing in my own words here) the data doesn&#39;t matter and the kids only got the shots because they wanted extra services....</p>\n\n<p>No vested interest in not going to jail there...<br />\nAs a general rule though, SNOPES is not considered a scientific source, so if you are interested in actually studying science, you need to learn to cite from peer reviewed journal articles instead. AND read the entire article. The method and results are the most important parts, since conclusions and summaries can leave out a lot. And if you study statistics you can see if they have been doing dodgy stuff with combining groups etc to lose statistical significance. Science is a great thing. But it is not the same as citing popular opinion and hoping &quot;they&quot; are right. There are  a lot of scientific peer reviewed articles cited here. You might find it interesting to read and expand your ideas a little.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tHera |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c745bc53970b\">February 04, 2015 at 08:32 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e95d14970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e95d14970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e95d14970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/11-50si.gif\" alt=\"Who is William Thompson ?\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e95d14970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e95d14970d-content\"><p>Peter , Saraleigh , Science </p>\n\n<p>We are all deluded here .

The public arena can then decide the merits of your arguments. My grandson regessed into autism shortly after his first birthday; this coincided with the administration of MMR vaccine. He was a much loved baby with lots of attention from his parents and extended family members, with whom he engaged socially. At 12 months he was far too young to have suddenly acquired &#39;psychological factors&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s perfectly true that older autistic children can often also suffer from depression and psychological illnesses, but what comes first -the chicken or the egg? In my grandson&#39;s case -definitely the egg -in the form of a syringe full of MMR vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>People do read the comments here, but a majority of these parents believe their children, like my grandson, were damaged by a vaccine. </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tJenny Allan |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7453443970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7453443970b\">February 04, 2015 at 07:49 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e8d82a970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e8d82a970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e8d82a970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/07-50si.gif\" alt=\"peter\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e8d82a970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e8d82a970d-content\"><p>I thought that this was a good site but no one comments on anything.

Sorry about such a comment because indeed all of those scientists could have been wrong; but in this particular case of believing that a psychological factor caused autism, they were only partly wrong. They were in the ball park but it is debatable whether it is a psychological factor depending on whether you are in the psychological ball park where you consider a psychological factor as something that the child psychological respond to and. or just as something that psychological affects the mind and/or the brain and or/also the brain. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion (considered opinion), the first, if negative and particularly traumatic, affects the child&#39;s mind and brain to start the roll towards a mental illness when he/she is an adult whereas the second causes a mental illness immediately and or can cause a mental illness immediately. So, early scientists and or more likely doctors who thought that a negative psychological factor caused the mental illness of autism just as negative psychological factors cause mental illnesses when the child became an adult were obviously wrong in some ways because obviously you can not have it both ways; but they were right if they considered the second meaning of psychological factors and particularly if they were to have looked for a traumatic factor as likewise obviously, it could not have been a cold love factor as they thought; but it had to be a traumatic factor as the effects were immediate. There is obviously only one such factor that I can think about, and you too should see it easy, as fortunately, it is obvious; yet absurd, weird and unbelievable; but with research, we may also see that it is highly probable; but even then unbelievable because it is so obvious and I can&#39;t not see why we could not think about it and consider it. I still can&#39;t see how anyone could miss such a factor and/or indeed not consider it; and I think that it is time that someone in authority considers it and/or researching it. <br />\nIncidentally, I should give up writing before the owner/directors/ and or controller of this site starts to ignore me; and/or I write a book on such a thing. Incidentally being there , done that, but as you can see, I am a poor writer etc. and it was rejected several time ie 2 times. I do not want to go there again. It is time to address my own problems of the brain and mind, the age of dementias. Sorry for that mistake but hopefully anyone that reads this will be helpful and if and when you see holes in the case, point them out and we will see can we address them, if they are consider worth while to address; and of course, everything is worthy of addressing if you have the time.

I can not see how or why such an article can/could be ignored, or rather I can see. <br />\nObviously, they are caught up in the momentum; and the desire; and we all have or should have the desire. We all want to see diseases done away with (eradicated); and the immunization program is commendable and desirable but we must go easy with such a big step; and we haven&#39;t; (there are so many things that need to be researched there)but now we have done some of that research or at least have had the opportunity to do so unfortunately with young children who may have paid the price; but also, as you know mental illnesses were always around; and so it may not be necessarily specifically individual due to the immunization program as there are so many other environmental factors that can do it; and several of these have increased just as the immunization program has; and I guess that correlation data can/maybe/should answer that question; however, we can expect a lot of it to be due to the immunization program and possible other changes in our environment. It maybe/is a product of the times and civilization/the age of autism and other mental illnesses in children and seniors. <br />\nPS please do not attack my computer       <br />\n</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tpeter |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e76621970d#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e76621970d\">February 02, 2015 at 08:14 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/07-50si.gif\" alt=\"peter\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c-content\"><p>RE cia parker | February 01, 2015 at 07:17 PM </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your response; and I agree with you in that one of the causes of autism is very probably the measles  vaccine whatever one causes measles encephalitis or some other brain problem (you can easy google that to see which one). In fact, I think that Dr. Wakefield has done excellent research and commend him and the lancet for publishing it; however unfortunately but as could be expected under the circumstances, and also what usually happens for example it happened with a scientist in the 1900&#39;s who published against an articles about sugars and their negative health effect/affects; he was discredited and ruined; but what he and you are missing is that there can be many causes and the measles vaccine is just one of them but there is only one psychological mechanism of producing autism and/or all other mental illnesses in children that have no knowing cause.<br />\nThanks for your reply. <br />\nIncidentally, as I said, originally, scientist believed that a psychological factor was the cause and all of those scientists can&#39;t be wrong but somehow the research has forged ahead, gained momentum and forgotten the original premises and that is somehow the flaw in the whole issue. You can not ignore anything in type of research whether it is in autism research or immunization research. You have to follow any lead; and this is so important when we are talking about a child and particularly his/her brain and really what do we know about it all anyway. We know very little about the brain; and also about the mind; etc. It is however very sensitive when so young and it is just beginning; and what you put in it, you get out of it. It is not something to rush ahead with. </p>\n\n<p>Well, that&#39;s enough for now, but I could talk about the brain and mind and proper research; and how to research all day and tomorrow also; but I am in my quiet years; and I have my aging mind and brain to think about and repair. All that abusive fluid thinking must be repaired; and that is my objective for this year. <br />\n <br />\n</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tpeter |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0cd32be970c\">February 02, 2015 at 07:31 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e71ccd970d\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e71ccd970d\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e71ccd970d-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/01-50si.gif\" alt=\"cia parker\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e71ccd970d-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201bb07e71ccd970d-content\"><p>Peter,<br />\nThe cause of autism is vaccines.

Cathy, I hope this message arrives to you in good health, you can attribute the fact that you&#39;re alive to vaccines. It saddens me that there is still a population of idiotic simpletons like yourself that truly deep down believes vaccines cause autism, despite the overwhelming evidence that they do not. Now, because of arrogant folks like yourself, many easily preventable and treatable diseases are on the rise. Have you ever seen a child with measles before? Do you realize how miserable and contagious the disease is? Probably not, because based on your twisted and skewed beliefs you don&#39;t spend much time off the internet, let alone in a healthcare setting. I surely hope less and less people believe the trash you post on this page as nearly all of it is completely baseless insensate rambling.

At least 1 in 4 parents know FOR SURE that one of the vaccines caused their childs problem because it literally started in the doctors office or right after the shots, or within a day.  Many of the others FEEL like the vaccines caused it because the problems started shortly after a vaccine.  Very few deny that vaccines had anything to do with it.  I don&#39;t know for sure, and i do not tell parents one way or another, but i treat with frequencies, and when i treat an autistic kid the first &quot;remedies&quot; i use are one to counteract vaccines, and 100% respond in a positive way within two treatments (a week or two).  Believe what you want......i am 100% sure if i had kids again i would not vaccinate.</p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tPauly |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c740d675970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c740d675970b\">January 28, 2015 at 03:19 PM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c60365970c\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-even comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c60365970c\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c60365970c-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/01-50si.gif\" alt=\"patricia\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c60365970c-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c60365970c-content\"><p>Caroline G you sound like a smart girl.

Even so, there are strong warnings on vaccine inserts about NOT vaccinating anyone known to be immune suppressed, or pregnant mums, the latter due to the rubella risks to unborn children. Half dead DOES NOT equate to harmless in these cases.</p>\n\n<p>Incidently, in spite of \u00a3$billions spent on dedicated genetic research, no evidence has been found to prove Autism is an inherited genetic condition, but even the much vilified 1998 Wakefield et al Lancet paper, suggested there might be a genetic susceptibility to damage from the live, but attenuated viruses in the MMR vaccine. </p></span>\n\t</div>\n\t<p class=\"comment-footer font-entryfooter\">\n\t\tPosted by:\n\t\tJenny Allan |\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ageofautism.com/2014/08/vaccines-cause-autism.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c1ecab970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b8d0c1ecab970c\">January 17, 2015 at 02:55 AM</a>\n\t</p>\n</div><a id=\"c6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7384538970b\"></a>\n<div class=\"comment font-entrybody comment-odd comment-has-avatar\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7384538970b\">\n\t<div class=\"comment-avatar\">\n\t\t<img id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7384538970b-avatarimg\" src=\"http://static.typepad.com/.shared:v8a7cafb:typepad:en_us/default-userpics/01-50si.gif\" alt=\"Linda1\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"comment-content font-entrybody\" id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7384538970b-content\">\n\t\t<span id=\"comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201b7c7384538970b-content\"><p>The contention that childhood seizures do not cause permanent damage is an assumption.

The heritability of autism, however, is complex, and it is typically unclear which genes are responsible.[2] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[3] Many other causes have been proposed, such as childhood immunizations, but numerous epidemiological studies have shown no scientific evidence supporting any link between vaccinations and autism&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Proof 1 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1188990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1188990/</a></p>\n\n<p>Proof 2 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n1/full/4001896a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n1/full/4001896a.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Proof 3  Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM.

A half dead version of the original illness. To cause Autism via vaccine would mean the weakened virus would somehow need to bypass the immune system - which would entirely negate the point of a vaccine - and then do something that the healthy virus couldn&#39;t do and alter the genetic coding of the child in question. It&#39;s impossible, illogical and disproved. Please, stop deluding yourselves by fixating on this hypothetical fantasy and focus on some REAL problems.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I have Asperger&#39;s Syndrome myself. To say that vaccines cause Autism implies disorders like my own are diseases that are contagious and can be spread beyond genetics. This is not true and can be construed as offensive by some people.

That way, you can be sure you are getting the truth. Conducted this study with tens of thousands of individuals from across the nation or even across the globe and you will get your data. Then, report the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth back to us, the readers. </p>\n\n<p>Also, just for your information, the Autism Science Foundation states that there is no link between autism and vaccines. Check out the board of directors, and I doubt you&#39;ll find anyone looking for an edge or trying to hide something. </p>\n\n<p>And please don&#39;t claim anything without hard proof and data. It is hard to argue with data, unless you claim it has been falsified. And also, how do you explain the numerous studies conducted that don&#39;t show a link from around the world?
