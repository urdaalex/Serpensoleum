The main signs and symptoms of autism involve communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>Children with autism might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may spend a lot of time putting things in order before they can pay attention, or they may say the same sentence again and again to calm themselves down. They often seem to be in their \"own world.\"</p>\n\n<p>Because people with autism can have very different features or symptoms, health care providers think of autism as a \"spectrum\" disorder. Asperger syndrome is a milder version of the disorder.</p>\n\n<p>The cause of autism is not known. Autism lasts throughout a person&#39;s lifetime. There is no cure, but treatment can help. Treatments include behavior and communication therapies and medicines to control symptoms. Starting treatment as early as possible is important.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-muted\">\tNIH:  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</p> <small class=\"text-muted\">Health information from the National Library of Medicine</small></span>\r\n    <span itemprop=\"cause\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/MedicalCause\"></span><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\r\n\r\n<hr><div class=\"row\" style=\"margin:0 -.3em;\">\r\n<h3>Related Videos</h3>\r\n<div class=\"row masonry\" style=\"margin:-.499em;\"><div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4 item\" style=\"padding:.5em;\">\r\n\t\t<div style=\"border:1px solid #ddd;

Dr. Tara Narula joins \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss the findings.</p>\r\n<h2>Diabetes and Pregnancy</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Also called: Gestational diabetes </strong></p>\r\n<p>Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. When you are pregnant, high blood sugar levels are not good for your baby.</p>\r\n<p>About seven out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant. Most of the time, it goes away after you have your baby. But it does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes later on. Your child is also at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n<p>Most women get a test to check for diabetes during their second trimester of pregnancy. Women at higher risk may get a test earlier.</p>\r\n<p>If you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood sugar is before you get pregnant. High blood sugar levels can be harmful to your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy - even before you know you are pregnant. To keep you and your baby healthy, it is important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible before and during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>Either type of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances of problems for you and your baby. To help lower the chances talk to your health care team about</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A meal plan for your pregnancy</li>\r\n<li>A safe exercise plan</li>\r\n<li>How often to test your blood sugar</li>\r\n<li>Taking your medicine as prescribed.

Pregnant women who develop influenza have a higher rate of autism in their newborns. The Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, says autism has increased 10-fold over the past 40 years. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) now affects one in 88 American children. So, who wouldn&#39;t roll up their sleeve to lower the risk? Here&#39;s Dennis Douda for the Mayo Clinic News Network.</p>\r\n<h2>Infections and Pregnancy</h2>\r\n<p>If you are pregnant, an infection can be more than just a problem for you. Some infections can be dangerous to your baby. You can help yourself avoid infections:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don&#39;t eat raw or undercooked meat</li>\r\n<li>Don&#39;t share food or drinks with other people</li>\r\n<li>Wash your hands frequently</li>\r\n<li>Don&#39;t empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You may need to take medicines or get a vaccine to prevent an infection in your baby. For example, you may need to take antibiotics if you develop an infection with group B strep, or take medicines if you have genital herpes. Only some medicines and vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider about how best to protect you and your baby.</p>\r\n<h2>Flu</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Also called: Grippe, Influenza</strong></p>\r\n<p>Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. Between 5% and 20% of people in the U.S. get the flu each year. The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and are worse than those of the common cold. They may include</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Body or muscle aches</li>\r\n<li>Chills</li>\r\n<li>Cough</li>\r\n<li>Fever</li>\r\n<li>Headache</li>\r\n<li>Sore throat</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Is it a cold or the flu? Colds rarely cause a fever or headaches. Flu almost never causes an upset stomach. And \"stomach flu\" isn&#39;t really flu at all, but gastroenteritis.</p>\r\n<p>Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care. If you get the flu, your health care provider may prescribe medicine to help your body fight the infection and lessen symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>The main way to keep from getting the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine. Good hygiene, including hand washing, can also help.</p>\r\n<p>NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</p></p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-footer\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"modal1083612843\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"modal1083612843Label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n\t\r\n      <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</button>\r\n        <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"modal1083612843Label\">BBC - My Autism and Me (VIDEO)</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-body\">\r\n        \r\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"videoPlayer1083612843\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.thevisualmd.com/swfobject.js'></script>\r\n                                <script type='text/javascript'>\r\n                                  var so = new SWFObject('http://www.thevisualmd.com/video_measurement/swf/player.swf','mpl','100%','340','11');\r\n                                so.addParam('allowscriptaccess','always');\r\n                                so.addParam('allowfullscreen','true');\r\n                                so.addParam('WMODE','transparent');\r\n                                so.addVariable('image','');\r\n                                so.addVariable('file','http://www.thevisualmd.com/http://youtu.be/ejpWWP1HNGQ');\r\n                                so.addVariable('allowscriptaccess','always');\r\n                                so.addVariable('allowfullscreen','true');\r\n                                //so.addVariable('file','videoboxsingleplaylist.xml');\r\n                                so.addVariable('skin','http://www.thevisualmd.com/player/skins/modieus/modieus.zip');\r\n                                so.addVariable('wmode','transparent');\r\n                                so.addVariable('show_pause','true');\r\n                                so.addVariable('abouttext','TheVisualMD');\r\n                                so.addVariable('aboutlink','http://www.thevisualmd.com');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.file','http://www.thevisualmd.com/images/bug.png');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.hide','false');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.link','http://www.thevisualmd.com');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.position','bottom-right');\r\n                                so.addVariable('screencolor','000000');\r\n                                //so.addVariable('skin','http://www.thevisualmd.com/player/skins/modieus/modieus.zip');\r\n                                so.addVariable('volume','100');\r\n                                so.addVariable('icons','true');\r\n                                so.write('videoPlayer1083612843');\r\n                                </script>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p><p><strong>BBC - My Autism and Me _ AustismAssociationS&#39;s channel</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Video Topic : </strong>CBBC Newsround - My Autism and Me<br />LICENCE - all rights reserved by BBC, CBBC Programmes, Newsround<br />In this Newsround Special, 13-year-old Rosie takes viewers into her world to explain what it&#39;s like to grow up with autism - a condition which affects how children see life, and the way they relate to others around them.<br />With the help of beautifully crafted animation, Rosie introduces other children who have the condition: Tony, who gets totally obsessed with things but struggles to make friends, Ben, who has suffered from terrible bullying, and Rosie&#39;s own little brother Lenny, who turns the house upside-down daily to try and make sense of things.<br />These children tell their own stories in their own words to give a vivid and moving insight into what it&#39;s like to be autistic.</p>\r\n<p>It&#39;s a condition that affects the way you live your life and see the world around you.<br />Our presenter Rosie was born with autism.

Together, these birth defects commonly are called \u201corofacial clefts\u201d. These birth defects happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both a cleft lip and cleft palate.</p>\r\n<h3>FACIAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>\r\n<p>A baby\u2019s head forms early during pregnancy. To make the face, body tissue and special cells from each side of the head grow toward the center of the face and join together. This joining of tissue forms the facial features, like the lips and mouth.</p>\r\n<h3>CLEFT LIP</h3>\r\n<p>The lip forms between the fourth and seventh weeks of pregnancy. A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This results in an opening in the upper lip. The opening in the lip can be a small slit or it can be a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. A cleft lip can be on one or both sides of the lip or in the middle of the lip, which occurs very rarely. Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate.</p>\r\n<h3>CLEFT PALATE</h3>\r\n<p>The roof of the mouth (palate) is formed between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy. A cleft palate happens if the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join together completely during pregnancy.<br /><br />For some babies, both the front and back parts of the palate are open. For other babies, only part of the palate is open.</p>\r\n<h3>OCCURRENCE</h3>\r\n<p>CDC recently estimated that, each year in the United States, about 2,650 babies are born with a cleft palate and 4,440 babies are born with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.<br />Isolated orofacial clefts, or clefts that occur with no other major birth defects, are one of the most common types of birth defects in the United States.<br />Depending on the cleft type, the rate of isolated orofacial clefts can vary from 50% to 80%.</p>\r\n<h3>CAUSES</h3>\r\n<p>Like the many families of children with birth defects, CDC wants to find out what causes them. Understanding the factors that can increase the chance of having a baby with a birth defect will help us learn more about the causes. CDC coordinates, funds, and collaborates on one of the largest studies in the United States\u2015the<br /><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/nbdps.html\">National Birth Defects Prevention Study</a>\u2015to understand the causes of and risks for birth defects, including orofacial clefts.</p>\r\n<p>The causes of orofacial clefts among most infants are unknown. Some children have a cleft lip or cleft palate because of changes in their<br /><a class=\"pop-over\">genes</a>. Cleft lip and cleft palate are thought to be caused by a combination of genes and other factors, such as things the mother comes in contact with in her environment, or what the mother eats or drinks, or certain medications she uses during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, CDC reported on important findings from research studies about some factors that increase the chance of having a baby with an orofacial cleft:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Smoking\u2015Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with an orofacial cleft than women who do not smoke.</li>\r\n<li>Diabetes\u2015Women with diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy have an increased risk of having a child with a cleft lip with or without cleft palate, compared to women who did not have diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>Use of certain medicines\u2015Women who used certain medicines to treat epilepsy, such as topiramate or valproic acid, during the first trimester (the first 3 months) of pregnancy have an increased risk of having a baby with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, compared to women who didn\u2019t take these medicines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>\r\n<p>Orofacial clefts, especially cleft lip with or without cleft palate, can be diagnosed during pregnancy by a routine ultrasound. They can also be diagnosed after the baby is born, especially cleft palate. However, sometimes certain types of cleft palate (for example, submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula) might not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>\r\n<h3>MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT</h3>\r\n<p>Children with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate or a cleft palate alone often have problems with feeding and speaking clearly, and can have ear infections. They also might have hearing problems and problems with their teeth. Services and treatment for children with orofacial clefts can vary depending on the severity of the cleft; the child\u2019s age and needs; and the presence of associated syndromes or other birth defects, or both.</p>\r\n<p>Surgery to repair a cleft lip usually occurs in the first few months of life and is recommended within the first 12 months of life. Surgery to repair a cleft palate is recommended within the first 18 months of life or earlier if possible.<br />Many children will need additional surgical procedures as they get older. Surgical repair can improve the look and appearance of a child\u2019s face and might also improve breathing, hearing, and speech and language development. Children born with orofacial clefts might need other types of treatments and services, such as special dental or orthodontic care or speech therapy.</p>\r\n<p>Because children with orofacial clefts often require a variety of services that need to be provided in a coordinated manner throughout childhood and into adolescence and sometimes adulthood, the American Cleft Palate - Craniofacial Association recommends services and treatment by cleft and craniofacial teams.<br />Cleft and craniofacial teams provide a coordinated approach to care for children with orofacial clefts. These teams usually consist of experienced and qualified physicians and health care providers from different specialties..</p>\r\n<p>With treatment, most children with orofacial clefts do well and lead a healthy life. Some children with orofacial clefts may have issues with self-esteem if they are concerned with visible differences between themselves and other children. Parent-to-parent support groups can prove to be useful for families of babies with birth defects of the head and face, such as orofacial clefts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Text by</strong><br />Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCBDDD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div></p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-footer\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"modal1083614945\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"modal1083614945Label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n\t\r\n      <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</button>\r\n        <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"modal1083614945Label\">Communication disorders _ Understanding Stuttering (VIDEO)</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-body\">\r\n        \r\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"videoPlayer1083614945\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.thevisualmd.com/swfobject.js'></script>\r\n                                <script type='text/javascript'>\r\n                                  var so = new SWFObject('http://www.thevisualmd.com/video_measurement/swf/player.swf','mpl','100%','340','11');\r\n                                so.addParam('allowscriptaccess','always');\r\n                                so.addParam('allowfullscreen','true');\r\n                                so.addParam('WMODE','transparent');\r\n                                so.addVariable('image','');\r\n                                so.addVariable('file','http://www.thevisualmd.com/http://youtu.be/VaSZbcf9tX4');\r\n                                so.addVariable('allowscriptaccess','always');\r\n                                so.addVariable('allowfullscreen','true');\r\n                                //so.addVariable('file','videoboxsingleplaylist.xml');\r\n                                so.addVariable('skin','http://www.thevisualmd.com/player/skins/modieus/modieus.zip');\r\n                                so.addVariable('wmode','transparent');\r\n                                so.addVariable('show_pause','true');\r\n                                so.addVariable('abouttext','TheVisualMD');\r\n                                so.addVariable('aboutlink','http://www.thevisualmd.com');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.file','http://www.thevisualmd.com/images/bug.png');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.hide','false');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.link','http://www.thevisualmd.com');\r\n                                so.addVariable('logo.position','bottom-right');\r\n                                so.addVariable('screencolor','000000');\r\n                                //so.addVariable('skin','http://www.thevisualmd.com/player/skins/modieus/modieus.zip');\r\n                                so.addVariable('volume','100');\r\n                                so.addVariable('icons','true');\r\n                                so.write('videoPlayer1083614945');\r\n                                </script>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p><h2>Understanding Stuttering</h2>\r\n<p><strong>image Caption :</strong> Muscles that Move the Tongue: Illustration of Muscles that Move the Tongue</p>\r\n<p>Image by OpenStax College</p>\r\n<h2>Stuttering</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Also called: Stammering</strong></p>\r\n<p>Stuttering is a problem that affects the flow of your speech. If you stutter, you may</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make certain words sound longer than they should be</li>\r\n<li>Find it hard to start a new word</li>\r\n<li>Repeat words or parts of words</li>\r\n<li>Get tense when you try to speak. You may blink your eyes rapidly, or your lips and jaw may tremble as you struggle to get the words out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Stuttering can affect anyone. It is most common in young children who are still learning to speak. Boys are three times more likely to stutter than girls. Most children stop stuttering as they grow older. Less than 1 percent of adults stutter.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists don&#39;t fully understand why some people stutter. The problem seems to run in families. There is no cure, but treatments can help. They include stuttering therapy, electronic devices, and self-help groups.

ASD includes a wide range, \u201ca spectrum,\u201d of symptoms, skills, and levels of disability.</p>\r\n<p>People with ASD often have these characteristics:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Ongoing social problems that include difficulty communicating and interacting with others</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repetitive behaviors as well as limited interests or activities</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Symptoms that typically are recognized in the first two years of life</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Symptoms that hurt the individual\u2019s ability to function<br />socially, at school or work, or other areas of life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some people<br>are mildly impaired by their symptoms, while others are severely disabled. Treatments and services can improve a person&#39;s symptoms and ability to function. Families with concerns should talk to their pediatrician about what they&#39;ve observed and the possibility of ASD screening. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) around 1 in 68 children has been identified with some form of ASD.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the difference between Asperger\u2019s syndrome and ASD?</h2>\r\n<p>In the past, Asperger&#39;s syndrome and Autistic Disorder were separate disorders. They were listed as subcategories within the diagnosis of \"Pervasive Developmental Disorders.\" However, this separation has changed. The latest edition of the manual from the American Psychiatric Association, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), does not highlight subcategories of a larger disorder. The manual includes the range of characteristics and severity within one category. People whose symptoms were previously diagnosed as Asperger&#39;s syndrome or Autistic Disorder are now included as part of the category called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</p>\r\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>\r\n<p>Parents or doctors may first identify ASD behaviors in infants and toddlers. School staff may recognize these behaviors in older children. Not all people with ASD will show all of these behaviors, but most will show several. There are two main types of behaviors: \u201crestricted / repetitive behaviors\u201d and \u201csocial communication / interaction behaviors.\u201d</p>\r\n<h3>Restrictive / repetitive behaviors may include:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having a lasting, intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Social communication / interaction behaviors may include:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Getting upset by a slight change in a routine or being placed in a new or overly stimulating setting</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Making little or inconsistent eye contact</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having a tendency to look at and listen to other people less often</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Responding in an unusual way when others show anger, distress, or affection</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or other verbal attempts to gain attention</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversations</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Often talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving others a chance to respond</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repeating words or phrases that they hear, a behavior called<em>echolalia</em></li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Using words that seem odd, out of place, or have a special meaning known only to those familiar with that person\u2019s way of communicating</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having trouble understanding another person\u2019s point of view or being unable to predict or understand other people\u2019s actions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with ASD may have other difficulties, such as being very sensitive to light, noise, clothing, or temperature. They may also experience sleep problems, digestion problems, and irritability.</p>\r\n<p>ASD is unique in that it is common for people with ASD to have many strengths and abilities in addition to challenges.</p>\r\n<p>Strengths and abilities may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Having above-average intelligence - the CDC reports  46% of ASD children have above average intelligence</li>\r\n<li>Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time</li>\r\n<li>Being strong visual and auditory learners</li>\r\n<li>Exceling in math, science, music, or art.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Diagnosing ASD</h3>\r\n<p>Doctors diagnose ASD by looking at a child\u2019s behavior and development. Young children with ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by age two.</p>\r\n<p>Older children and adolescents should be evaluated for ASD when a parent or teacher raises concerns based on watching the child socialize, communicate, and play.</p>\r\n<p>Diagnosing ASD in adults is not easy. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, getting a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past difficulties, identify his or her strengths, and obtain the right kind of help.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Diagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process:</strong></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Stage 1: General Developmental Screening During Well-Child Checkups</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Every child should receive well-child check-ups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health care provider. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends  specific ASD screening be done at the 18- and 24-month visits.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASD or developmental problems. Those at high risk include children who:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Have a sister, brother, or other family member with ASD</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Have some ASD behaviors</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Were born premature, or early, and at a low birth weight.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Parents\u2019 experiences and concerns are very important in the screening process for young children. Sometimes the doctor will ask parents questions about the child\u2019s behaviors and combine this information with his or her observations of the child.</p>\r\n<p>Children who show some developmental problems during this screening process will be referred for another stage of evaluation.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Stage 2: Additional Evaluation</strong></h3>\r\n<p>This evaluation is with a team of doctors and other health professionals with a wide range of specialties who are experienced in diagnosing ASD. This team may include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A developmental pediatrician\u2014a doctor who has special training in child development</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A child psychologist and/or child psychiatrist\u2014a doctor who knows about brain development and behavior</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A speech-language pathologist\u2014a health professional who has special training in communication difficulties.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The evaluation may assess:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Cognitive level or thinking skills</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Language abilities</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs along with other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Blood tests</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Hearing test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The outcome of the evaluation will result in recommendations to help plan for treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Diagnosis in older children and adolescents</h2>\r\n<p>Older children whose ASD symptoms are noticed after starting school are often first recognized and evaluated by the school\u2019s special education team. The school\u2019s team may refer these children to a health care professional.</p>\r\n<p>Parents may talk with a pediatrician about their child\u2019s social difficulties including problems with subtle communication. These subtle communication issues may include understanding tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. Older children may have trouble understanding figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. Parents may also find that their child has trouble forming friendships with peers. The pediatrician can refer the child for further evaluation and treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Diagnosis in adults</h2>\r\n<p>Adults who notice the signs and symptoms of ASD should talk with a doctor and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. While testing for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults can be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist with ASD expertise. The expert will ask about concerns, such as social interaction and communication challenges, sensory issues, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Information about the adult\u2019s developmental history will help in making an accurate diagnosis, so an ASD evaluation may include talking with parents or other family members.</p>\r\n<h2>Risk Factors</h2>\r\n<p>Scientists don\u2019t know the exact causes of ASD, but research suggests that genes and environment play important roles.</p>\r\n<p>Risk factors include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gender-boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than girls</li>\r\n<li>Having a sibling with ASD</li>\r\n<li>Having older parents  (a mother who was 35 or older, and/or a father who was 40 or older when the baby was born)</li>\r\n<li>Genetics-about 20% of children with ASD also have certain genetic conditions. Those conditions include Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis among others.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In recent years, the number of children identified with ASD has increased. Experts disagree about whether this shows a true increase in ASD since the guidelines for diagnosis have changed in recent years as well. Also, many more parents and doctors now know about the disorder, so parents are more likely to have their children screened, and more doctors are able to properly diagnose ASD, even in adulthood.</p>\r\n<h2>Treatments and Therapies</h2>\r\n<p>Early treatment for ASD and proper care can reduce individuals\u2019 difficulties while helping them learn new skills and make the most of their strengths. The very wide range of issues facing those \u201con the spectrum\u201d means that there is no single best treatment for ASD. Working closely with a doctor or health care professional is an important part of finding the right treatment program. There are many treatment options, social services, programs, and other resources that can help.<br /><br />Here are some tips.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Keep a detailed notebook. Record conversations and meetings with health care providers and teachers. This information helps when its time to make decisions.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Record doctors&#39; reports and evaluations in the notebook. This information may help an individual qualify for special programs.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Contact the local health department, school, or autism advocacy groups to learn about their special programs.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Talk with a pediatrician, school official, or physician to find a local autism expert who can help develop an intervention plan and find other local resources.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Find an autism support group. Sharing information and experiences can help individuals with ASD and/or their caregivers learn about options, make decisions, and reduce stress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Medication</h2>\r\n<p>A doctor may use medication to treat some difficulties that are common with ASD. With medication, a person with ASD may have fewer problems with:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Irritability</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Aggression</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repetitive behavior</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Hyperactivity</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Attention problems</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Anxiety and depression</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Join a Study</h2>\r\n<p>Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs, new psychotherapies or devices, or new ways to use existing treatments. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.</p>\r\n<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</p>\r\n<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>\r\n<h2>Definition</h2>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a group of developmental disorders. ASD includes a wide range, \"a spectrum,\" of symptoms, skills, and levels of disability.</p>\r\n<p>People with ASD often have these characteristics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ongoing social problems that include difficulty communicating and interacting with others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Repetitive behaviors as well as limited interests or activities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Symptoms that typically are recognized in the first two years of life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Symptoms that hurt the individual&#39;s ability to function socially, at school or work, or other areas of life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some people are mildly impaired by their symptoms, while others are severely disabled. Treatments and services can improve a person&#39;s symptoms and ability to function. Families with concerns should talk to their pediatrician about what they&#39;ve observed and the possibility of ASD screening. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  around 1 in 68 children has been identified with some form of ASD.</p>\r\n<p><span>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</span></p>\r\n<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Also called: ASD, Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) </strong></p>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person&#39;s life.

They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.</p>\r\n<p>A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.</p>\r\n<p>Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the \"palate.\" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly. Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.</p>\r\n<p>Children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. They also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth.</p>\r\n<p>Often, surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older. With treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"attribution\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>\r\n<div class=\"span19 pagetitle\">\r\n<div class=\"syndicate\">\r\n<div class=\"mSyndicate\">\r\n<h2>Facts about Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"share-bar\" class=\"span19\">\r\n<div class=\"socialmediabar\">\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"span8\"><a id=\"content-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"body\" class=\"span19\">\r\n<div id=\"contentArea\">\r\n<div class=\"syndicate\">\r\n<div class=\"mSyndicate\">\r\n<div class=\"pull-right span6\"><img title=\"Baby with cleft lip\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/images/cleftlip_small.jpg\" alt=\"Baby wih a cleft lip\" width=\"250\" height=\"260\" />\r\n<p class=\"txtCenter\"><br></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Baby with cleft palate\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/images/cleft_palate_small.jpg\" alt=\"Baby with Cleft Palate\" width=\"275\" height=\"186\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"txtCenter\"><br></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby\u2019s lip or mouth do not form properly during pregnancy. Together, these birth defects commonly are called \u201corofacial clefts\u201d. These birth defects happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both a cleft lip and cleft palate.</p>\r\n<h3>FACIAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>\r\n<p>A baby\u2019s head forms early during pregnancy. To make the face, body tissue and special cells from each side of the head grow toward the center of the face and join together. This joining of tissue forms the facial features, like the lips and mouth.</p>\r\n<h3>CLEFT LIP</h3>\r\n<p>The lip forms between the fourth and seventh weeks of pregnancy. A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This results in an opening in the upper lip. The opening in the lip can be a small slit or it can be a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. A cleft lip can be on one or both sides of the lip or in the middle of the lip, which occurs very rarely. Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate.</p>\r\n<h3>CLEFT PALATE</h3>\r\n<p>The roof of the mouth (palate) is formed between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy. A cleft palate happens if the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join together completely during pregnancy.<br /><br />For some babies, both the front and back parts of the palate are open. For other babies, only part of the palate is open.</p>\r\n<h3>OCCURRENCE</h3>\r\n<p>CDC recently estimated that, each year in the United States, about 2,650 babies are born with a cleft palate and 4,440 babies are born with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.<br />Isolated orofacial clefts, or clefts that occur with no other major birth defects, are one of the most common types of birth defects in the United States.<br />Depending on the cleft type, the rate of isolated orofacial clefts can vary from 50% to 80%.</p>\r\n<h3>CAUSES</h3>\r\n<p>Like the many families of children with birth defects, CDC wants to find out what causes them. Understanding the factors that can increase the chance of having a baby with a birth defect will help us learn more about the causes. CDC coordinates, funds, and collaborates on one of the largest studies in the United States-the National Birth Defects Prevention Study-to understand the causes of and risks for birth defects, including orofacial clefts.</p>\r\n<p>The causes of orofacial clefts among most infants are unknown. Some children have a cleft lip or cleft palate because of changes in their genes. Cleft lip and cleft palate are thought to be caused by a combination of genes and other factors, such as things the mother comes in contact with in her environment, or what the mother eats or drinks, or certain medications she uses during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, CDC reported on important findings from research studies about some factors that increase the chance of having a baby with an orofacial cleft:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Smoking\u2015Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with an orofacial cleft than women who do not smoke.</li>\r\n<li>Diabetes\u2015Women with diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy have an increased risk of having a child with a cleft lip with or without cleft palate, compared to women who did not have diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>Use of certain medicines\u2015Women who used certain medicines to treat epilepsy, such as topiramate or valproic acid, during the first trimester (the first 3 months) of pregnancy have an increased risk of having a baby with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, compared to women who didn\u2019t take these medicines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>\r\n<p>Orofacial clefts, especially cleft lip with or without cleft palate, can be diagnosed during pregnancy by a routine ultrasound. They can also be diagnosed after the baby is born, especially cleft palate. However, sometimes certain types of cleft palate (for example, submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula) might not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>\r\n<h3>MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT</h3>\r\n<p>Children with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate or a cleft palate alone often have problems with feeding and speaking clearly, and can have ear infections. They also might have hearing problems and problems with their teeth. Services and treatment for children with orofacial clefts can vary depending on the severity of the cleft; the child\u2019s age and needs; and the presence of associated syndromes or other birth defects, or both.</p>\r\n<p>Surgery to repair a cleft lip usually occurs in the first few months of life and is recommended within the first 12 months of life. Surgery to repair a cleft palate is recommended within the first 18 months of life or earlier if possible.<br />Many children will need additional surgical procedures as they get older. Surgical repair can improve the look and appearance of a child\u2019s face and might also improve breathing, hearing, and speech and language development. Children born with orofacial clefts might need other types of treatments and services, such as special dental or orthodontic care or speech therapy.</p>\r\n<p>Because children with orofacial clefts often require a variety of services that need to be provided in a coordinated manner throughout childhood and into adolescence and sometimes adulthood, the American Cleft Palate - Craniofacial Association recommends services and treatment by cleft and craniofacial teams.</p>\r\n<p>Cleft and craniofacial teams provide a coordinated approach to care for children with orofacial clefts. These teams usually consist of experienced and qualified physicians and health care providers from different specialties.<br />Cleft and craniofacial teams and centers are located throughout the United States and other countries.</p>\r\n<p>With treatment, most children with orofacial clefts do well and lead a healthy life. Some children with orofacial clefts may have issues with self-esteem if they are concerned with visible differences between themselves and other children. Parent-to-parent support groups can prove to be useful for families of babies with birth defects of the head and face, such as orofacial clefts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Text by</strong><br />Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCBDDD, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"body\" class=\"span19\">\r\n<div id=\"contentArea\">\r\n<div class=\"syndicate\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div></p></div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-footer\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"modal1083612844\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"modal1083612844Label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n      <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</button>\r\n        <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"modal1083612844Label\">Autism Spectrum Disorder - Diagnosing ASD</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-body\"><div style=\"background-color:#000;margin-bottom:1em;\"><embed src=\"imageViewer.swf\" style=\"margin:10px 0; width:100%;\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" height=\"400\" overstretch=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" logo=\"/images/banners/logo2_small.png\" flashvars=\"file=rss_image_selected.php?id_url=1083612844&amp;logo=/images/banners/logo2_small.png&amp;overstretch=false&amp;wmode=transparent\"/></div><small class=\"text-muted pull-right\" style=\"font-size:.75em;margin-top:-10px;\">Source: Ralph&#045;Axel Muller http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Powell2004Fig1A.jpeg</small><br><p><p><strong>Image Caption :</strong> fMRI-derived image of difference between brains of autistic and control groups.

These professionals are usually psychologists, psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists or medical geneticists.</p>\r\n<p>The diagnosis of autism is made when there are a specific number of symptoms as defined by the Diagnostic and Standard Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Some commonly used diagnostic tests are the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), the ABC (Autism Behavior Checklist) and the GARS (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale). Formal diagnosis by an autism specialist usually depends on completing the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale), and ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised). The CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) is often used in pediatrican&#39;s offices to screen for autism symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>When physical features, small head size or brain malformations are present or there is a family history of relatives with autism, genetic testing such as chromosome analysis and single-gene testing is done.</p>\r\n<p>NHGRI / NIH</p>\r\n<h2>Diagnosing ASD</h2>\r\n<p>Doctors diagnose ASD by looking at a child\u2019s behavior and development. Young children with ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by age two.</p>\r\n<p>Older children and adolescents should be evaluated for ASD when a parent or teacher raises concerns based on watching the child socialize, communicate, and play.</p>\r\n<p>Diagnosing ASD in adults is not easy. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, getting a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past difficulties, identify his or her strengths, and obtain the right kind of help.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Diagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process:</strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 1: General Developmental Screening During Well-Child Checkups</strong></p>\r\n<p>Every child should receive well-child check-ups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health care provider. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends specific ASD screening be done at the 18- and 24-month visits.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASD or developmental problems. Those at high risk include children who:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Have a sister, brother, or other family member with ASD</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Have some ASD behaviors</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Were born premature, or early, and at a low birth weight.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Parents\u2019 experiences and concerns are very important in the screening process for young children. Sometimes the doctor will ask parents questions about the child\u2019s behaviors and combine this information with his or her observations of the child.</p>\r\n<p>Children who show some developmental problems during this screening process will be referred for another stage of evaluation.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Stage 2: Additional Evaluation</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This evaluation is with a team of doctors and other health professionals with a wide range of specialties who are experienced in diagnosing ASD. This team may include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A developmental pediatrician\u2014a doctor who has special training in child development</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A child psychologist and/or child psychiatrist\u2014a doctor who knows about brain development and behavior</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">A speech-language pathologist\u2014a health professional who has special training in communication difficulties.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The evaluation may assess:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Cognitive level or thinking skills</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Language abilities</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs along with other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Blood tests</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Hearing test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The outcome of the evaluation will result in recommendations to help plan for treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Diagnosis in older children and adolescents</h2>\r\n<p>Older children whose ASD symptoms are noticed after starting school are often first recognized and evaluated by the school\u2019s special education team. The school\u2019s team may refer these children to a health care professional.</p>\r\n<p>Parents may talk with a pediatrician about their child\u2019s social difficulties including problems with subtle communication. These subtle communication issues may include understanding tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. Older children may have trouble understanding figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. Parents may also find that their child has trouble forming friendships with peers. The pediatrician can refer the child for further evaluation and treatment.</p>\r\n<h2>Diagnosis in adults</h2>\r\n<p>Adults who notice the signs and symptoms of ASD should talk with a doctor and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. While testing for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults can be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist with ASD expertise. The expert will ask about concerns, such as social interaction and communication challenges, sensory issues, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests.

It ranges in severity from relatively mild social and communicative impairments to a severe disability requiring lifelong parental, school and societal support.</p>\r\n<p>The hallmark symptom of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they don&#39;t understand social cues provided by tone of voice or facial expressions and they don&#39;t watch other people&#39;s faces to pick up on these cues.</p>\r\n<p>Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking, spinning, twirling or jumping, or in self-abusive behavior such as hand biting or head-banging.</p>\r\n<p>Of children being diagnosed now with an autism spectrum disorder, about half will have mental retardation defined by nonverbal IQ testing and 25 percent will also develop seizures. Though most children show signs of autism in the first year of life, about 30 percent will seem fine and then regress in both their language and social interactions at around 18 months of age.</p>\r\n<p>About 30 percent of children with autism have physical signs of some alteration in early development such as physical features that differ from their parents (sometimes called dysmorphic features), small head size (microcephaly) or structural brain malformations.</p>\r\n<p>NHGRI / NIH</p>\r\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>\r\n<p>Parents or doctors may first identify ASD behaviors in infants and toddlers. School staff may recognize these behaviors in older children. Not all people with ASD will show all of these behaviors, but most will show several. There are two main types of behaviors: \u201crestricted / repetitive behaviors\u201d and \u201csocial communication / interaction behaviors.\u201d</p>\r\n<h2>Restrictive / repetitive behaviors may include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having a lasting, intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Social communication / interaction behaviors may include:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Getting upset by a slight change in a routine or being placed in a new or overly stimulating setting</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Making little or inconsistent eye contact</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having a tendency to look at and listen to other people less often</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Responding in an unusual way when others show anger, distress, or affection</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or other verbal attempts to gain attention</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversations</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Often talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving others a chance to respond</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repeating words or phrases that they hear, a behavior called<em>echolalia</em></li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Using words that seem odd, out of place, or have a special meaning known only to those familiar with that person\u2019s way of communicating</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Having trouble understanding another person\u2019s point of view or being unable to predict or understand other people\u2019s actions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with ASD may have other difficulties, such as being very sensitive to light, noise, clothing, or temperature. They may also experience sleep problems, digestion problems, and irritability.</p>\r\n<p>ASD is unique in that it is common for people with ASD to have many strengths and abilities in addition to challenges.</p>\r\n<p>Strengths and abilities may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Having above-average intelligence - the CDC reports  46% of ASD children have above average intelligence</li>\r\n<li>Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time</li>\r\n<li>Being strong visual and auditory learners</li>\r\n<li>Excelling in math, science, music, or art.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</span></p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Also called: ASD, Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person&#39;s life.

The nature of the treatment will differ, based upon a person&#39;s age, communication goals, and other factors. If you or your child stutters, it is important to work with a speech-language pathologist to determine the best treatment options.</p>\r\n<p>For very young children, early treatment may prevent developmental stuttering from becoming a lifelong problem. Certain strategies can help children learn to improve their speech fluency while developing positive attitudes toward communication. Health professionals generally recommend that a child be evaluated if he or she has stuttered for three to six months, exhibits struggle behaviors associated with stuttering, or has a family history of stuttering or related communication disorders. Some researchers recommend that a child be evaluated every three months to determine if the stuttering is increasing or decreasing. Treatment often involves teaching parents about ways to support their child&#39;s production of fluent speech. Parents may be encouraged to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide a relaxed home environment that allows many opportunities for the child to speak. This includes setting aside time to talk to one another, especially when the child is excited and has a lot to say.</li>\r\n<li>Refrain from reacting negatively when the child stutters. Instead, parents should react to the stuttering as they would any other difficulty the child may experience in life. This may involve gentle corrections of the child&#39;s stuttering and praise for the child&#39;s fluent speech.</li>\r\n<li>Be less demanding on the child to speak in a certain way or to perform verbally for people, particularly if the child experiences difficulty during periods of high pressure.</li>\r\n<li>Speak in a slightly slowed and relaxed manner. This can help reduce time pressures the child may be experiencing. Listen attentively when the child speaks and wait for him or her to say the intended word. Don&#39;t try to complete the child&#39;s sentences. Also, help the child learn that a person can communicate successfully even when stuttering occurs.</li>\r\n<li>Talk openly and honestly to the child about stuttering if he or she brings up the subject. Let the child know that it is okay for some disruptions to occur.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Stuttering therapy</h2>\r\n<p>Many of the current therapies for teens and adults who stutter focus on learning ways to minimize stuttering when they speak, such as by speaking more slowly, regulating their breathing, or gradually progressing from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences. Most of these therapies also help address the anxiety a person who stutters may feel in certain speaking situations.</p>\r\n<h2>Drug therapy</h2>\r\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drug for the treatment of stuttering. However, some drugs that are approved to treat other health problems-such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression-have been used to treat stuttering. These drugs often have side effects that make them difficult to use over a long period of time. In a recent study funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), researchers concluded that drug therapy has been largely ineffective in controlling stuttering. Clinical trials of other possible drug treatments are currently under way.</p>\r\n<h2>Electronic devices</h2>\r\n<p>Some people who stutter use electronic devices to help control fluency. For example, one type of device fits into the ear canal, much like a hearing aid, and digitally replays a slightly altered version of the wearer&#39;s voice into the ear so that it sounds as if he or she is speaking in unison with another person. In some people, electronic devices help improve fluency in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, questions remain about how long such effects may last and whether people are able to easily use these devices in real-world situations. For these reasons, researchers are continuing to study the long-term effectiveness of these devices.</p>\r\n<h2>Self-help groups</h2>\r\n<p>Many people find that they achieve their greatest success through a combination of self-study and therapy. Self-help groups provide a way for people who stutter to find resources and support as they face the challenges of stuttering.</p>\r\n<p>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders / NIH</p>\r\n<h2>Stuttering</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Also called: Stammering</strong></p>\r\n<p>Stuttering is a problem that affects the flow of your speech. If you stutter, you may</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make certain words sound longer than they should be</li>\r\n<li>Find it hard to start a new word</li>\r\n<li>Repeat words or parts of words</li>\r\n<li>Get tense when you try to speak. You may blink your eyes rapidly, or your lips and jaw may tremble as you struggle to get the words out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Stuttering can affect anyone. It is most common in young children who are still learning to speak. Boys are three times more likely to stutter than girls. Most children stop stuttering as they grow older. Less than 1 percent of adults stutter.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists don&#39;t fully understand why some people stutter. The problem seems to run in families. There is no cure, but treatments can help. They include stuttering therapy, electronic devices, and self-help groups. Starting stuttering therapy early for young children can keep it from becoming a lifelong problem.</p>\r\n<p>NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</p>\r\n<h2>Speech and Communication Disorders</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Also called: Communication disorders</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many disorders can affect our ability to speak and communicate. They range from saying sounds incorrectly to being completely unable to speak or understand speech.

They were listed as subcategories within the diagnosis of \"Pervasive Developmental Disorders.\" However, this separation has changed. The latest edition of the manual from the American Psychiatric Association, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), does not highlight subcategories of a larger disorder. The manual includes the range of characteristics and severity within one category. People whose symptoms were previously diagnosed as Asperger&#39;s syndrome or Autistic Disorder are now included as part of the category called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</p>\r\n<h2>What is Asperger syndrome?</h2>\r\n<p>Asperger syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one of a distinct group of complex neurodevelopment disorders characterized by social impairment, communication difficulties, and restrictive, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.  Other ASDs include autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS).  ASDs are considered neurodevelopmental disorders and are present from infancy or early childhood.  Although early diagnosis using standardized screening by age 2 is the goal, many with ASD are not detected until later because of limited social demands and support from parents and caregivers in early life.</p>\r\n<p>The severity of communication and behavioral deficits, and the degree of disability, is variable in those affected by ASD.  Some individuals with ASD are severely disabled and require very substantial support for basic activities of daily living.  Asperger syndrome is considered by many to be the mildest form of ASD and is synonymous with the most highly functioning individuals with ASD.</p>\r\n<p>Two core features of autism are: a) social and communication deficits and b) fixated interests and repetitive behaviors.  The social communication deficits in highly functioning persons with Asperger syndrome include lack of the normal back and forth conversation; lack of typical eye contact, body language, and facial expression; and trouble maintaining relationships.  Fixated interests and repetitive behaviors include repetitive use of objects or phrases, stereotyped movements, and excessive attachment to routines, objects, or interests.  Persons with ASD may also respond to sensory aspects of their environment with unusual indifference or excessive interest.</p>\r\n<p>The prevalence of AS is not well established.  It is often not recognized before age 5 or 6 because language development is normal.  Although ASD varies significantly in character and severity, it occurs in all ethnic and socioeconomic groups and affects every age group.  Experts estimate that as many as 1 in 88 children age 8 will have an autism spectrum disorder1  No studies have yet been conducted to determine the incidence of Asperger syndrome in adult populations, but studies of children with the disorder suggest that their problems with socialization and communication continue into adulthood.  Some of these children develop additional psychiatric symptoms and disorders in adolescence and adulthood.  Males are four times more likely than girls to have ASD.</p>\r\n<p>Studies of children with Asperger syndrome suggest that their problems with socialization and communication continue into adulthood.  Some of these children develop additional psychiatric symptoms and disorders in adolescence and adulthood.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is it called Asperger syndrome?</h2>\r\n<p>In 1944, an Austrian pediatrician named Hans Asperger observed four children in his practice who had difficulty integrating socially.  Although their intelligence appeared normal, the children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically awkward.  Their speech was either disjointed or overly formal, and their all-absorbing interest in a single topic dominated their conversations.  Dr. Asperger called the condition \"autistic psychopathy\" and described it as a personality disorder primarily marked by social isolation.</p>\r\n<p>Asperger&#39;s observations, published in German, were not widely known until 1981, when an English doctor named Lorna Wing published a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, which she called \"Asperger&#39;s\" syndrome.  Wing&#39;s writings were widely published and popularized.  AS became a distinct disease and diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth published edition of the World Health Organization&#39;s diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and in 1994 it was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s diagnostic reference book.   However, scientific studies have not been able to definitively differentiate Asperger syndrome from highly functioning autism.  Because autism is defined by a common set of behaviors, changes that were announced in DSM-V (which took effect in mid-2013) represent the various forms under a single diagnostic category, ASD.</p>\r\n<p>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke / NIH</p>\r\n<p>http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm</p>\r\n<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Also called: ASD, Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person&#39;s life.

Characteristic facial features include a long, narrow face; a high forehead; flushed (reddened) cheeks; and a small, pointed chin. In addition, the outside corners of the eyes may point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures). This facial appearance is most notable in early childhood. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers and have an unusually large head. However, adult height is usually in the normal range.</p>\r\n<p>People with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual disability, and most also have behavioral problems. Frequent behavioral issues include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessions and compulsions, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors. Problems with speech and language are also common. Affected individuals often have a stutter, a monotone voice, and problems with sound production. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.</p>\r\n<p>Other signs and symptoms of Sotos syndrome can include an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), seizures, heart or kidney defects, hearing loss, and problems with vision. Some infants with this disorder experience yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and poor feeding.</p>\r\n<p>A small percentage of people with Sotos syndrome have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer occurs most frequently with this condition.

(<span>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)</span></h2>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutation in the NSD1 gene on chromosome 5.  It is characterized by excessive physical growth during the first few years of life. Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and are often taller, heavier, and have larger heads (macrocrania) than is normal for their age. Symptoms of the disorder, which vary among individuals, include a disproportionately large and long head with a slightly protrusive forehead and pointed chin, large hands and feet, hypertelorism (an abnormally increased distance between the eyes), and down-slanting eyes. The disorder is often accompanied by mild cognitive impairment; delayed motor, cognitive, and social development; hypotonia (low muscle tone), and speech impairments. Clumsiness, an awkward gait, and unusual aggressiveness or irritability may also occur. Although most cases of Sotos syndrome occur sporadically (meaning they are not known to be inherited), familial cases have also been reported.</p>\r\n<h2>Is there any treatment?</h2>\r\n<p>There is no standard course of treatment for Sotos syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the prognosis?</h2>\r\n<p>Sotos syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy. The initial abnormalities of Sotos syndrome usually resolve as the growth rate becomes normal after the first few years of life. Developmental delays may improve in the school-age years, and adults with Sotos syndrome are likely to be within the normal range for intellect and height. However, coordination problems may persist into adulthood.</p>\r\n<h2>What research is being done?</h2>\r\n<p>The NINDS supports and conducts a wide range of studies which focus on identifying and learning more about the genes involved in normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, thus, may eventually give clues to understanding disorders such as Sotos syndrome.</p>\r\n<p>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p></p></div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-footer\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"modal1083611915\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"modal1083611915Label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\r\n    <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n      <div class=\"modal-header\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</button>\r\n        <h4 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"modal1083611915Label\">Autism Spectrum Disorder - Treatments and Therapies</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-body\"><div style=\"background-color:#000;margin-bottom:1em;\"><embed src=\"imageViewer.swf\" style=\"margin:10px 0; width:100%;\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" height=\"400\" overstretch=\"false\" wmode=\"transparent\" logo=\"/images/banners/logo2_small.png\" flashvars=\"file=rss_image_selected.php?id_url=1083611915&amp;logo=/images/banners/logo2_small.png&amp;overstretch=false&amp;wmode=transparent\"/></div><small class=\"text-muted pull-right\" style=\"font-size:.75em;margin-top:-10px;\">Source: Zipster969, link to pawsitivityservicedogs.com http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Service_Dog_in_hospital_bed.jpg</small><br><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Image Caption :</strong> Service Dog in hospital bed: Service dog for a boy with autism calms him during 24-hour EEG</p>\r\n<h2>What is the treatment for autism?</h2>\r\n<p>There is currently no cure for autism. However, autism can be managed and shaped at a young age, even as early as pre-school. Early intensive therapy can have a positive effect on development later in life.</p>\r\n<p>Treatment of autism involves medical and behavioral therapies to help children with conversational language and social interactions. Treatment also involves helping children decrease their repetitive, self-stimulatory behaviors, tantrums and self-injurious behavior.</p>\r\n<p>Medications can help treat specific symptoms such as aggressive or self-injurious behavior, inattention, poor sleep and repetitive behaviors. However, no medications are autism specific and medications should be used in conjunction with a family-centered, behavioral and educational program.</p>\r\n<p>NHGRI / NIH</p>\r\n<h2>Treatments and Therapies</h2>\r\n<p>Early treatment for ASD and proper care can reduce individuals\u2019 difficulties while helping them learn new skills and make the most of their strengths. The very wide range of issues facing those \u201con the spectrum\u201d means that there is no single best treatment for ASD. Working closely with a doctor or health care professional is an important part of finding the right treatment program. There are many treatment options, social services, programs, and other resources that can help.<br /><br />Here are some tips.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Keep a detailed notebook. Record conversations and meetings with health care providers and teachers. This information helps when its time to make decisions.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Record doctors&#39; reports and evaluations in the notebook. This information may help an individual qualify for special programs.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Contact the local health department, school, or autism advocacy groups to learn about their special programs.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Talk with a pediatrician, school official, or physician to find a local autism expert who can help develop an intervention plan and find other local resources.</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Find an autism support group. Sharing information and experiences can help individuals with ASD and/or their caregivers learn about options, make decisions, and reduce stress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Medication</h3>\r\n<p>A doctor may use medication to treat some difficulties that are common with ASD. With medication, a person with ASD may have fewer problems with:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul_default\">\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Irritability</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Aggression</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Repetitive behavior</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Hyperactivity</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Attention problems</li>\r\n<li class=\"generic-container\">Anxiety and depression</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</span></p>\r\n<h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Also called: ASD, Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person&#39;s life. It affects how a person acts and interacts with others, communicates, and learns. It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders.</p>\r\n<p>It is called a \"spectrum\" disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms. People with ASD might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. They may spend a lot of time putting things in order, or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their \"own world.\"</p>\r\n<p>At well-child checkups, the health care provider should check your child&#39;s development. If there are signs of ASD, your child will have a comprehensive evaluation. It may include a team of specialists, doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis.</p>\r\n<p>The causes of ASD are not known. Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles.</p>\r\n<p>There is currently no one standard treatment for ASD. There are many ways to increase your child&#39;s ability to grow and learn new skills. Starting them early can lead to better results. Treatments include behavior and communication therapies, skills training, and medicines to control symptoms.</p>\r\n<p>NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</p></p></div>\r\n      <div class=\"modal-footer\">\r\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"col-md-4 hidden-xs\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--            <div class=\"panel panel-info panel-related-popular\" id=\"panel-related\">\r\n              <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n                <h3 class=\"panel-title\"><span class=\"badge pull-right\"># of videos</span>Related Centers</h3>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"center.php?idg=8219\" class=\"list-group-item\"><span class=\"badge\">14</span>Cancer Introduction</a>\r\n                 <a href=\"center.php?idg=8188\" class=\"list-group-item\"><span class=\"badge\">12</span>Prostate Cancer</a>\r\n                 <a href=\"center.php?idg=8181\" class=\"list-group-item\"><span class=\"badge\">8</span>Colorectal Cancer</a>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n            \r\n                              \r\n                              \r\n\t\t\t<div style=\\\"border:1px solid #999; width:100%; max-width:100%; margin-top:10px;padding: auto 25%; \\\">\r\n            \t<div id=\\\"hcReadMoreRelatedLinksTitle\\\" style=\\\"width:100%; border:none; text-align:center; margin:10px auto;\\\">Related links</div>\r\n                <div id=\\\"hcReadMoreRelatedLinkResultWindow\\\" style=\\\"width:100%; margin-top:10px; border:none; text-align:center;\\\">\r\n            \t\t<p>Clinical Trials: Breast Cancer</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"#\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>\r\n           \t\t </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n                              <div id=\"adsenePlaceHolder\"></div>\r\n                              -->\r\n \r\n \r\n <style>.ad_space {background:#fff;color:#eee;font-size:4.2em;font-weight:bold;padding-top:0px;min-height:300px;width:100%;text-align:center;margin:-2px 0 42px 0;cursor:pointer;border:4.2px solid #e3e3e3;border-radius:5px;\r\n -moz-box-shadow: 5px 3px 3px #fcfcfc;\r\n-webkit-box-shadow: 5px 3px 3px #fcfcfc;\r\nbox-shadow:5px 3px 3px #fcfcfc;\r\n} \r\n .ad_space img {width:100%;max-width:300px;}\r\n .ad_space:hover {border:4.2px solid #f6f6f6;opacity:.9;}\r\n @media all and (max-width: 767px) {\r\n\t.ad_space {display:none;}\r\n\t\r\n\t.ad_space4 {display:none;}\r\n }\r\n </style>\r\n\r\n <div id=\"banner3\" class=\"ad_space\" align=\"right\">\r\n <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\r\n<!-- 300 x 600 Vertical TVMD -->\r\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\r\n     style=\"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:600px\"\r\n     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8472772263301201\"\r\n     data-ad-slot=\"4963903429\"></ins>\r\n<script>\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n <!--<div class=\"ad_space\" id=\"banner1\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-visualmd-diet/id587947675?mt=11\" ><img id=\"banner1img\" width=\"100%\" src=\"img/ads/diet_ibook_wo_border_up.jpg\" onmouseover=\"this.src='img/ads/diet_ibook_w_o_border_over.jpg'\"  onmouseout=\"this.src='img/ads/diet_ibook_wo_border_up.jpg'\"  /></a></div>-->\r\n <div class=\"ad_space\" id=\"banner2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/conception-to-birth-by-thevisualmd.com/id556720361?mt=11\"><img id=\"banner2img\" width=\"100%\" src=\"img/ads/ibook.jpg\" onmouseover=\"this.src='img/ads/ibook_over.jpg'\" onmouseout=\"this.src='img/ads/ibook.jpg'\" /></a></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<hr>\r\n\t<small class=\"text-muted\">The material on this site is for informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
