Graceview Baptist Church in Tomball, Tex., early one Saturday morning in January, two armed guards stood prominently just inside the doorway of the sanctuary. Their eyes scanned the room and returned with some frequency to a man sitting near the aisle, whom they had been hired to protect.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"864\" data-total-count=\"1177\">The man, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/andrew_wakefield/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Andrew Wakefield.\" class=\"meta-per\">Andrew Wakefield</a>, dressed in a blazer and jeans and peering through reading glasses, had a mild professorial air. He tapped at a laptop as the room filled with people who came to hear him speak; he looked both industrious and remote. Broad-shouldered and fair at 54, he still has the presence of the person he once was: a conventional winner, the captain of his medical school\u2019s rugby team, the head boy at the private school he attended in England. Wakefield was a high-profile but controversial figure in gastroenterology research at the Royal Free Hospital in London when, in 1998, he upended his career path \u2014 and more significant, the best-laid plans of public-health officials \u2014 by announcing at a press conference that he had concerns about the safety of the <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Measles.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">measles</a>-<a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/mumps/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Mumps.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">mumps</a>-<a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/rubella/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about German Measles (Rubella).\" class=\"meta-classifier\">rubella</a> vaccine (M.M.R.) and its relationship to the onset of <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/autism/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Autism.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">autism</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1441\" data-total-count=\"2618\">Although Wakefield did not claim to have proved that the M.M.R. vaccine (typically given to children at 12 to 15 months) caused autism, his concerns, not his caveats, ricocheted around the world. His belief, based on a paper he wrote about 12 children, is that the three vaccines, given together, can alter a child\u2019s immune system, allowing the measles virus in the vaccine to infiltrate the intestines; certain proteins, escaping from the intestines, could then reach and harm neurons in the brain. Few theories have drawn so much attention and, in turn, so much refutation: a 2003 paper in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, which reviewed a dozen epidemiological studies, concluded that there was no evidence of an association between autism and M.M.R., and studies in peer-reviewed journals since have come to the same conclusion. In Britain, the General Medical Council revoked Wakefield\u2019s medical license after a lengthy hearing, citing numerous ethical violations that tainted his work, like failing to disclose financing from lawyers who were mounting a case against vaccine manufacturers. The Lancet, which published the original Wakefield paper, retracted it. In a series that ran early this year, The British Medical Journal concluded that the research was not just unethically financed but also \u201cfraudulent\u201d (that timelines were misrepresented, for example, to suggest direct culpability of the vaccine).</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"365\" data-total-count=\"2983\">Andrew Wakefield has become one of the most reviled doctors of his generation, blamed directly and indirectly, depending on the accuser, for irresponsibly starting a panic with tragic repercussions: vaccination rates so low that childhood diseases once all but eradicated here \u2014 <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pertussis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Pertussis.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">whooping cough</a> and measles, among them \u2014 have re-emerged, endangering young lives.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental first\" id=\"supplemental-1\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-1\">\n        <div id=\"FlexAd\" class=\"ad flex-ad nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n\t    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n\t    <div class=\"flex-ad-creative\"></div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"547\" data-total-count=\"3530\" id=\"story-continues-2\">And yet here he was in Texas, post-career-apocalypse, calmly discussing his work, and a crowd of around 250 people showed up to listen. As people walked into the lobby of the church in Tomball, they passed by a whiteboard with a message that asked attendees to express their thoughts to Wakefield. Many complied with lavish thanks: \u201cWe stand by you!\u201d and \u201cThank you for the many sacrifices you have made for the cause!\u201d When he finally took the podium, the audience members, mostly parents of autistic children, stood and applauded wildly.</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-3\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"895\" data-total-count=\"4425\" id=\"story-continues-3\">In his presentation, Wakefield sounded impatient but righteous. He used enough scientific terms \u2014 \u201cataxic,\u201d \u201chistopathological review\u201d and \u201cvaccine excipients\u201d \u2014 that those parents who did not feel cowed might have been flattered by his assumption of their scientific fluency. He also tried to defend himself against a few of the charges laid out in The British Medical Journal \u2014 offering defenses that did not hold up before the journal\u2019s panel of editors but were perhaps enough to assure an audience of his fans that he did, in fact, have defenses. Some part of Wakefield\u2019s cult status is surely because of his personal charisma, and he spoke with great rhetorical flair. He took off his glasses and put them back on like a gifted actor maximizing a prop. \u201cWhat happens to me doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cWhat happens to these children does matter.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"539\" data-total-count=\"4964\">After the talk, a line of visitors snaked down the length of the lobby, his followers waiting to have Wakefield sign a book he wrote about his experience and convictions, \u201cCallous Disregard.\u201d \u201cAll right, love?\u201d he said, handing the book back to one mother. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said when asked for a photo. A pregnant woman in the lobby told me she was there trying to educate herself. Another woman, with tears in her eyes, blamed herself for not working harder to obtain a separate <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/mmr-vaccine/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about MMR - vaccine.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">measles vaccine</a> for her possibly autistic child.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"699\" data-total-count=\"5663\">Michelle Guppy, the coordinator of the Houston Autism Disability Network and the organizer of the Tomball event, said she believed her own autistic son benefited greatly from one aspect of Wakefield\u2019s work: his conviction that untreated gastrointestinal problems could be behind some of autism\u2019s symptoms. It was Guppy, it turned out, who thought to hire the armed guards \u201cto make the statement,\u201d she said, \u201cthat this is neutral ground, and it\u2019s going to be civil.\u201d Guppy, a mother of two who was elegantly dressed for the occasion, made no pretense of neutrality herself. She narrowed her eyes when she learned that a writer from The New York Times was there to write about Wakefield.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"58\" data-total-count=\"5721\">\u201cBe nice to him,\u201d she said, \u201cor we will hurt you.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"418\" data-total-count=\"6139\"><strong>During a three-hour </strong>car ride from Tomball back to Austin, where he lives, Wakefield pointed out the curiosities of the area: a roadrunner, burning bales of hay. He was a gracious host in his adopted state, which he finds far more hospitable than the country he left. Sitting beside him was a bottle of Redline, an energy drink that promises a seven-hour boost. \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no crash.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"400\" data-total-count=\"6539\">Wakefield moved to Austin in 2004, a few years after he was asked to leave the Royal Free Hospital, reportedly because he didn\u2019t fulfill a request that he duplicate the findings in the Lancet paper. Supporters in Austin reached out to Wakefield after he gave a talk there, which led to his helping to found Thoughtful House Center for Children, a treatment and research center for kids with autism.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"816\" data-total-count=\"7355\">But after the General Medical Council found in January 2010 that Wakefield had committed ethical violations \u2014 subjecting developmentally disabled children to unnecessary invasive procedures, mishandling funds and failing to disclose conflicts of interest, to name a few \u2014 Wakefield resigned from Thoughtful House. The walls of his professional world have continued to close in. He no longer speaks at the popular Autism Research Institute conference, where he has prominently held court in the past. And to that segment of the American audience that may have been unfamiliar with his work until recently, he has been introduced primarily as a villain. When he was interviewed on CNN and invoked \u201cCallous Disregard,\u201d Anderson Cooper cut him off: \u201cBut sir, if you\u2019re lying, then your book is also a lie.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1347\" data-total-count=\"8702\">At the start of the drive, Wakefield spoke with the calmness of the self-certain, ready with a counterargument for every concern. How does he respond to the decline in vaccination rates that some attribute to his theory? If only officials had offered a single measles vaccine, he said, there would have been no uptick in unvaccinated children. (Immunologists argue that spacing out vaccines increases the likelihood that children will not receive all of the vaccines and that they could contract a serious illness during the interim.) Why was there no mention in his Lancet paper that initial pathology reports found little indication of bowel disease in the cases Wakefield wrote about? \u201cYou have incredibly limited space,\u201d he told me in a subsequent conversation. As for the accusation that he received financing for the paper from lawyers intending to sue vaccine manufacturers, he insisted that the money was for a separate study. And why did the lawyer behind the litigation essentially say otherwise on tape? \u201cHe was confused,\u201d Wakefield explained. His faith in his theory also remains intact, which he made clear when I asked him, in a separate interview, if he still believed M.M.R. caused the autism in the children in the Lancet paper. \u201cIs that a serious question?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I do still think M.M.R. was causing it.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"878\" data-total-count=\"9580\">For Wakefield, the attacks have become a kind of affirmation. The more he must defend his research, the more important he seems to consider it \u2014 so important that powerful forces have conspired and aligned against him. He said he believes that \u201cthey\u201d \u2014 public-health officials, pharmaceutical companies \u2014 pay bloggers to plant vicious comments about him on the Web. \u201cBecause it\u2019s always the same,\u201d he says. \u201cDiscredited doctor Andrew Wakefield, discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield.\u201d He also \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if public-health officials were inflating the number of measles mortalities, just as he thinks they inflate the risks of <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about The flu.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">the flu</a> to increase uptake of that vaccine. Having been rejected by mainstream medicine, Wakefield, the son of well-regarded doctors in Britain, has apparently rejected the integrity of mainstream medicine in return.</p><div id=\"story-ad-2\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-4\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"9878\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Wakefield never seemed too perturbed by my questions; if he felt any irritation, he took it out on his GPS, which he seemed to think was out to get him, just like his critics. \u201cThere\u2019s no left turn here, you idiot,\u201d he said to the disembodied voice. \u201cTurn right? Why? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"405\" data-total-count=\"10283\">Finally Wakefield allowed for an error in his judgment. \u201cI think the press conference is something we could have done without,\u201d he acknowledged. It is no small concession. The media response might not have been so inflammatory; vaccination rates might not have taken such a hit; and on a personal level, Wakefield might have at least been spared accusations of provoking hysteria with calculated hype.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"10518\">But, Wakefield clarified, he regretted the press conference only \u201cbecause it inflamed the public officials.\u201d In the long term, he said, it did not matter; eventually, they \u2014 the establishment \u2014 would have come after him anyway.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"231\" data-total-count=\"10749\"><strong>\u201cTo our community,</strong> Andrew Wakefield is Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ rolled up into one,\u201d says J. B. Handley, co-founder of Generation Rescue, a group that disputes vaccine safety. \u201cHe\u2019s a symbol of how all of us feel.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"512\" data-total-count=\"11261\">Since losing his medical license, Wakefield has depended on his followers for financing and for the emotional scaffolding that allows him to believe himself a truth-teller when the majority of his peers consider him a menace to medicine. The fact that his fans have stood by him through his denunciation may seem surprising, but they may find it easier to ignore his critics than to reject their faith in him. After all, his is a rare voice of certainty in the face of a disease that is, at its core, mysterious.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"489\" data-total-count=\"11750\">The diagnosis of autism can be devastating. In some cases, a child regresses between 12 and 24 months, baffling parents who do not recognize the child who has replaced the one they knew and has no words to explain. In other instances, they watch their friends\u2019 children sit up, babble and reach out for hugs, when their own do not. Unable to communicate, a small percentage of autistic children bite their own arms raw or bang their heads against the wall, for reasons poorly understood.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"329\" data-total-count=\"12079\">\u201cWe still do not have an explanation for the vast majority of autism cases,\u201d says Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, who is in charge of coordinating the $120 million worth of research being conducted on autism there. With regard to autism, Insel calls himself a \u201cprophet of humility.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"484\" data-total-count=\"12563\">Most researchers say that there is a rise in the number of children who are landing somewhere on the autism spectrum and that only some portion of that increase can be explained by raised awareness of the disorder. In this decade alone, Insel says, diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (which includes mild cases) have jumped to 1 in 110, from 1 in 150; in boys, it\u2019s now 1 in 70. He worries that the rate is accelerating. \u201cI would say I am losing sleep over this,\u201d Insel says.</p><figure id=\"media-100000000779414\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000000779414\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t_CA1/mag-24Autism-t_CA1-popup.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t_CA1/mag-24Autism-t_CA1-popup.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t_CA1/mag-24Autism-t_CA1-jumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Andrew Wakefield&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Eva Vermandel for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t_CA1/mag-24Autism-t_CA1-popup.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"500\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"405\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Andrew Wakefield<strong><br /></strong></span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Eva Vermandel for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"656\" data-total-count=\"13219\">What has become increasingly clear to Insel is that something is to blame. Some environmental factor is, or many environmental factors are, interacting with certain gene types, yielding who knows how many different pathways to the same disease. And although many parents think they know with instinctual certainty what that factor was in their own child, researchers \u201chaven\u2019t found anything that looks like a smoking gun,\u201d Insel says. To him, the M.M.R. vaccine, so aggressively studied since the media splash following Wakefield\u2019s 1998 paper, is one of the few factors that can be ruled out. But could it be aspartame? UV rays? Elmo? No one knows.</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-5\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"376\" data-total-count=\"13595\" id=\"story-continues-5\">\u201cWith autism, people have done this all along \u2014 grasped onto various explanations and reached premature closure on each of them,\u201d Insel says of Wakefield\u2019s work. \u201cWhat I take from the Wakefield story is that everyone is desperate to find answers to what we see as an urgent problem. And if I\u2019m really brutally honest about this, we still don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"556\" data-total-count=\"14151\">To parents who have run up against unsatisfying answers from the scientific community, Wakefield offers a combination of celebrity and empathy that leaves strong impressions. Michelle Guppy, the mother from the Houston Autism Disability Network who brought Wakefield to speak in Tomball, subsequently spoke to me on the phone about the experience she had at Thoughtful House. She had taken her adolescent son there after a series of mainstream doctors failed to help his constant <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Diarrhea.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">diarrhea</a>, which required her to change his diaper as many as 10 times a day.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"611\" data-total-count=\"14762\">\u201cI mean, I remember, Dr. Wakefield was there,\u201d Guppy said, her voice starting to quaver. \u201cAnd you know, it was just the validation. I don\u2019t care if my son was overtreated or cured \u2014 just the validation that we as parents who knew something was wrong got an answer. Just the fact that someone listened and someone tried to do something \u2014 someone said, \u2018Yeah, this is not just autism; your son has a real medical issue that we can treat.\u2019 I think that validation is all that parents want \u2014 just that someone is taking the symptoms we report and looking at them to see what can we do about it.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"420\" data-total-count=\"15182\">At Thoughtful House, her son was given an <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/endoscopy/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Endoscopy.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">endoscopy</a>, which is considered an invasive procedure. Following the diagnosis, a doctor there (who has also left Thoughtful House and has also come under a cloud of criticism) put him on anti-inflammatories and a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Perhaps her son\u2019s system was maturing anyway, but Guppy credits the treatment, and Wakefield, for vastly improving both their lives.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"859\" data-total-count=\"16041\">Wakefield\u2019s big theory \u2014 that M.M.R. causes a bowel disorder, which he calls autistic enterocolitis, that then causes autism \u2014 has been dismissed by mainstream medicine. And a position paper published last year in Pediatrics also stated that available research did not support the use of casein- and gluten-free diets in the general autistic population (the diets, adapted in extreme measures, can cause health complications of their own). But Timothy Buie, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Harvard Medical School and one of the paper\u2019s authors, felt that the press ignored other key implications in their findings: that there might be a subsection of autistic patients who would benefit from dietary interventions and that the role of the immune system in gastrointestinal dysfunction in children with autism \u201cwarrants additional investigation.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"433\" data-total-count=\"16474\">Buie makes it clear that he is no fan of Wakefield\u2019s; but he does say that Wakefield was a kind of pioneer in disseminating certain useful ideas about autism. Wakefield\u2019s least controversial conviction may be the belief that some symptoms of autism \u2014 repetitive body movements, leaning over furniture, self-injury \u2014 might be symptoms of gastrointestinal distress in an autistic population unable to verbalize that discomfort.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1072\" data-total-count=\"17546\">Pat Levitt, a neuroscientist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and an autism researcher in whom the National Institute of Mental Health has invested heavily, is also now interested in the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with autism. He has found a gene variant that is more prevalent in children who have autism and gastrointestinal problems than it is in children who have autism but no digestive irregularities. Levitt does not believe that a faulty gut is the cause of autism, as Wakefield theorized, but that the two problems might develop, in some subset of people on the autism spectrum, in tandem, each a result of a flawed interaction of genes and environment. He does not believe \u2014 as some of Wakefield\u2019s followers hoped \u2014 that by treating an intestinal malady, he will cure the underlying autism. \u201cBut is it the case that if you have GI problems, <em>that</em> can exacerbate your child\u2019s behavioral issues?\u201d says Levitt, whose recent work has not yet been replicated. \u201cThe answer is absolutely yes.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-4\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-6\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"442\" data-total-count=\"17988\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Levitt and Buie said they believed that for years parents\u2019 concerns about their autistic children\u2019s gastrointestinal problems were too often dismissed, partly because doctors associated those concerns with quackery and vaccine fears and the false hope that a diet could cure the autism itself. When Levitt gives talks, he sometimes puts a picture of Wakefield up on the screen. \u201cBad science,\u201d he then says, \u201cset us back 10 years.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"461\" data-total-count=\"18449\">The slow course of gastrointestinal research in autism \u2014 still a controversial subject \u2014 has fewer public-health implications than dropping vaccine rates do, but it is an interesting footnote, one of the odd legacies of Wakefield\u2019s work. He was adored by parents because he validated some of their most agonizing concerns when they felt few others would. But he was also one main reason that those medical symptoms were being dismissed in the first place.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"689\" data-total-count=\"19138\"><strong>If Andrew Wakefield\u2019s </strong>followers see him as a martyr, then his chief persecutor, in their eyes, is a British journalist named Brian Deer. Wakefield calls Deer a \u201chit man,\u201d though Deer claims no such agenda (he has been as critical of the medical establishment that allowed Wakefield to get as far as he did as he has been of Wakefield himself). Were it not for Deer, Wakefield might have been nothing more than a scientist who was proved wrong. But Deer, who has been investigating Wakefield since 2004 and who this April won the Specialist Journalist of the Year award from England\u2019s Society of Editors for his work, has presented a far more damning view of Wakefield to the world.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"861\" data-total-count=\"19999\">In his British Medical Journal series, Deer made the case that Wakefield was not just wrong but also unethical. He said that the doctor misrepresented at least one aspect of the medical condition of every child he wrote about in the study. Wakefield contests virtually every one of those charges, and it would take a book to encompass Deer\u2019s allegations, Wakefield\u2019s parries and Deer\u2019s counterproof. But one charge that Deer argues convincingly is that several children in the Lancet paper had records showing concerns about developmental delays before getting the M.M.R. shot. Deer points out that another child, whose record was more ambiguous, was seen by a doctor before receiving the M.M.R. vaccine, because his mother was concerned that his hearing was imperfect, \u201cwhich might sound like a hallmark presentation of classical autism,\u201d Deer wrote.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"723\" data-total-count=\"20722\">In Wakefield\u2019s presentation at the church in Tomball, he seized upon this detail as evidence of Deer\u2019s overreaching. He pointed out that Deer neglected to mention that the mother also reported to that same doctor that there was discharge from the child\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat does that suggest to you?\u201d he asked the audience. Some parents called out with confidence, \u201c<a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/ear-infection-acute/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Ear infection - acute.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Ear infection</a>,\u201d which \u2014 those parents were very likely to know \u2014 can impair a child\u2019s hearing. With that one example, Wakefield did what he does so skillfully: empowered parents as medical experts as he tried to undermine the credibility of his accusers, just enough to convince those who already support him that they are justified in doing so.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"946\" data-total-count=\"21668\">You could read Deer\u2019s collected body of research on Wakefield and come away with the conviction that Wakefield was an underhanded profiteer who exploited parents and abused their disabled children with invasive tests for the sole purpose of capitalizing on parents\u2019 fears about the M.M.R. vaccine. (He applied, for example, for a patent for a diagnostic kit that could test for measles virus in the intestines.) But Deer does not think Wakefield was solely motivated by profit. He compares him to the kind of religious leader who is a true believer but relies on the occasional use of smoke and mirrors to goose the faith of his followers. \u201cHe believed it was true,\u201d Deer says of Wakefield\u2019s theory of M.M.R., but he was also willing to stretch the truth to get more financing for more research. Deer theorizes that Wakefield\u2019s maneuverings were all rationalized by his conviction that he was right: \u201cHe would prove it next time.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"21918\"><strong>Wakefield now lives </strong>in a high-end Austin neighborhood, a private enclave where most homes, including his, enjoy generous acreage and bucolic views of the hills. \u201cYou can almost believe you\u2019re in Tuscany,\u201d he says of the view from his back deck.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"643\" data-total-count=\"22561\">A large dog roamed about the house; a very tall son watched an English soccer match; and Wakefield, while making coffee and emptying the dishwasher, continued to bat away charges. He claimed, for example, that a \u201csafer\u201d measles vaccine for which he filed a patent was not, in fact, a rival to M.M.R., which would have been a clear conflict of interest; it was instead an immune-boosting vaccine for those with compromised immune systems, an unfortunate semantic mix-up. (\u201cHe is very good at what I call whack-a-<a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/birthmarks-pigmented/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Birthmarks - pigmented.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">mole</a> arguments,\u201d says Seth Mnookin, author of \u201cThe Panic Virus,\u201d a history of the controversy over autism and vaccines.)</p><div id=\"story-ad-5\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-7\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"769\" data-total-count=\"23330\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Wakefield is a persuasive speaker, even when the listener knows better. As we talked, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of a clip of Wakefield I saw on YouTube. The video showed him at a conference in 1999, telling the audience about the time he lined up kids to give blood samples at the birthday party of one of his children: he needed a control group of children who did not have autism, and this was convenient. \u201cTwo children fainted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother threw up over his mother.\u201d For their service, they were rewarded with \u00a35. \u201cPeople said to me, \u2018Andrew, you know you can\u2019t do this to people; children won\u2019t come back,\u2019 \u201d he recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong \u2014 listen, we live in a free-market economy; next year, they\u2019ll want \u00a310.\u2019 \u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"473\" data-total-count=\"23803\">Clearly, drawing blood in that setting was part of no medical protocol that an ethics committee would ever approve. The General Medical Council, in its ruling against Wakefield, said that by engaging in this behavior, he displayed conduct that \u201cfell seriously short of the standards expected of a doctor and was a breach of the trust that the public is entitled to have in members of the medical profession\u201d and deemed the episode \u201cserious professional misconduct.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"995\" data-total-count=\"24798\">Wakefield was either na\u00efve or arrogant to think that he could joke on camera about the lengths to which he had gone in the pursuit of proving his theories right. But what is also striking about that video is the sound of the audience laughing. He had won over a room full of parents, who were caught up in the charm of a maverick. It was hard to imagine Wakefield making such a joke now; he has not retreated from his position, but he has shifted his sense of identity from that of a renegade to that of a martyr. He often says that he has stuck by a theory that \u201chas cost me my job, my livelihood and my country.\u201d The more he has sacrificed, the more he must believe in his theory \u2014 or else what was it all for? A quote from Peter Medawar, a British scientist who wrote a famous critique of a book of specious ideas about evolution, comes to mind: \u201cIts author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"520\" data-total-count=\"25318\">Wakefield continues to work with a sense of mission and an entrepreneurial savvy. Since leaving Thoughtful House, he has been working on a book about parents who have been falsely accused of <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Munchausen syndrome by proxy</a>: the world of false accusations, of unheard parents in pain \u2014 familiar territory, all of it. He is also trying to raise money for a center for autistic adults. It is a shrewd business move with explosive potential for growth: 80 percent of the autistic population in the U.S. is currently under 18.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"479\" data-total-count=\"25797\">That morning in Austin, Wakefield was on his way to yet another contentious interview in New York, this one with George Stephanopoulos. His son, who drove Wakefield and me to the airport, had no plans to follow in the footsteps of his parents and his paternal grandparents, all of whom were doctors: he was majoring in public relations and marketing instead. Perhaps his father\u2019s experience had taught him something about the perils of science and about the power of messaging.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"326\" data-total-count=\"26123\">It seems very unlikely that any study, no matter how carefully conducted, will assure Wakefield of the safety of M.M.R. at this point: numbers can lie, or be manipulated, and even paranoids have enemies. Didn\u2019t they laugh at the researcher who said bacteria caused <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/gastric-ulcer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Ulcers.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">ulcers</a>? Doesn\u2019t he owe it to the children to continue on?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"289\" data-total-count=\"26412\">Before leaving for the airport with Wakefield and his son, I took in the view from the deck. The hills looked lofty, peaceful, a little bit blurred in the distance \u2014 you could believe, as Wakefield had promised, you were in Tuscany. With a little effort, you can believe almost anything.<span class=\"tombstone\"><i class=\"icon\"></i></span></p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                <div class=\"story-notes\"><p>Susan Dominus (susan.dominus@nytimes.com) is a staff writer for the magazine.
